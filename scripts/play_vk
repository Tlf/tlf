# These script is responsible for playing voice key message files 
# on the command of the TLF main program.
# It gets called as 'play_vk filename' and plays the content of 
# the audio file 'filename' on the default sound device.
#
# You can adapt it to your convenience to 
# - mute or unmute your microphone
# - play different file formats or
# - use another output device
#
# An executable copy of 'play_vk' in your contest directory (containing the
# logcfg.dat file) can be adapted and has precedence over the standard install
