Q: Where can I download the latest callmaster call sign data file.

A: You can use the master.scp file from http://www.supercheckpartial.com
   Save it as 'callmaster' and copy it in the actual contest directory or 
   in TLF's global data directory (/usr/local/share/TLF). The file in the 
   actual contest directory takes precedence.

Q: Can I add my own list of call signs to the callmaster file.

A: Sure. Just add it to the end of the file -  each call (in uppercase)
   on a line  by itself.
   Be aware that at the moment the file is limited to 50000 entries.

Q: Where can I find an actual CTY.DAT file for TLF?

A: Try https://www.country-files.com/ Make sure to save it as 'cty.dat' in 
   lower case letters.
   Be aware that there a two different file formats:
   * For version before TLF-1.3.1 you have to use the old style CTY.DAT file
     with no embedded '=' character.
   * For newer versions you can also use the newer file format also used by
     >=CT9.91. It allows to give informations not only for call areas but
     for single stations with a call sign preceded by a '=' character. (See
     http://www.country-files.com/cty-dat-format/ for details).
     
Q: TLF thinks that I am in cq zone 5 but in fact I am in another one. How can 
   I fix that?

A: At the moment you have to modify your cty.dat file. Look for the entry
   for your country, e.g. for Canada look for 
   
   Canada:                   05:  09:  NA:   44.35:    78.75:     5.0:  VE:0

   Below that entry there may be lines with special prefixes and call signs 
   which counts also for Canada. Add yourself (VE3XYZ in the following
   example) to the list with the correct CQ zone appended in parentheses, e.g.

   =VE2IM(2)[4],=VY0PW(4)[3],=VE3XYZ(3);

   That would override the default setting for the CQ zone (5 for VE) 
   with your one (3). See also http://www.country-files.com/cty-dat-format/ 
   for a detailed description.

Q: How can I use a K1EL series of Winkeyers or similar devices (e.g. the K3NG
   arduino based ones)?

A: Yes. You can use one of the UDP related keying daemons out there for it.
   At the moment there are at least three different versions:
   * The Perl based 'Winkeydaemon' at https://github.com/N0NB/winkeydaemon
   * CQRLOG comes with 'Winkeyer USB' (see the link at
     https://github.com/ok2cqr/winkeyer_server)
   * The Python based 'pywinkeyerdaemon' at 
     https://github.com/drewarnett/pywinkeyerdaemon

Q: The generated ADIF file misses some entries, e.g. the CONTEST_ID which is
   used by my log program during import. Any idea to work around it?

A: You can use 'adifmerg' from OH7BF for it. It allows to post process the
   ADIF file.
   For instance you can add the missing CONTEST_ID with
      adifmerg -f qso.adi -A CONTEST_ID=<my contest name> -o > file.adi
   Have a look at www.adif.org for the already standardized contest IDs.

Q: I am using TLF in an XTerm. How can I configure used colors, fonts and
   window size?

A: You can  can use a .Xressources file in your home directory. See the
   Xressources example file in the doc directory. Follow the instructions
   given there to install it. You can use it also for URxvt terminals.
