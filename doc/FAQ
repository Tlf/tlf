Q: Where can I download the latest callmaster call sign data file.

A: You can use the master.scp file from http://www.supercheckpartial.com
   Save it as 'callmaster' and copy it in the actual contest directory or 
   in TLF's global data directory (/usr/local/share/TLF). The file in the 
   actual contest directory takes precedence.

Q: Can I add my own list of call signs to the callmaster file.

A: Sure. Just add it to the end of the file -  each call (in uppercase)
   on a line  by itself.
   Be aware that at the moment the file is limited to 50000 entries.

Q: Where can I find an actual CTY.DAT file for TLF?

A: Try http://www.country-files.com/ Make sure to save it as 'cty.dat' in 
   lower case letters.
   Be aware that there a two different file formats. Make sure to download 
   the file for TLF. 

Q: TLF thinks that I am in cq zone 5 but in fact I am in another one. How can 
   I fix that?

A: At the moment you have to modify your cty.dat file. Look for the entry
   for your country, e.g. for Canada look for 
   
   Canada:                   05:  09:  NA:   44.35:    78.75:     5.0:  VE:0

   Below that entry there may be lines with special prefixes and call signs 
   which counts also for Canada. Add yourself (VE3XYZ in the following
   example) to the list with the correct CQ zone appended in parentheses, e.g.

   VE2IM(2)[4],VY0PW(4)[3],VE3XYZ(3);

   That would override the default setting for the CQ zone (5 for VE) 
   with your one (3). See also http://www.country-files.com/cty-dat-format/ 
   for a detailed description.
