Q: Where can I download the latest callmaster call sign data file.

A: You can use the master.scp file from http://www.supercheckpartial.com
   Save it as 'callmaster' and copy it in the actual contest directory or 
   in TLF's global data directory (/usr/local/share/TLF). The file in the 
   actual contest directory takes precedence.

Q: Can I add my own list of callsigns to the callmaster file.

A: Sure. Just add it to the end of the file -  each call (in uppercase)
   on a line  by itself.
   Be aware that at the moment the file is limited to 50000 entries.

Q: Where can I find an actual CTY.DAT file for TLF?

A: Try http://www.country-files.com/ Make sure to save it as 'cty.dat' in 
   lower case letters.
   Be aware that there a two different file formats. Make sure to download 
   the file for TLF.
