Planned improvements for TLF-1.4 release
----------------------------------------

[x] make hamlib mandatory (finished Oct 2018, tnx Zoli)
[x] switch to hamlib's freq_t for frequencies (tnx Zoli)
    ( and maybe factor out hamlib stuff to a separate module ) 
[x] allow vertical resizing of tlf (more room for cluster messages)
[x] drop 'SCAN' menu with noise bridge, panorama scan and smeter
    display (It did not work for a long time and I think no one is
    using it)
[x] Handling multiplier aliases (see thread started by Nate in June)
[x] Allow other callmaster databases (hardcoded or by CALLMASTER= keyword)
[x] Rework startup display for better readability by user

Planned for later versions
--------------------------

[ ] automatically switch back to 'Run' mode from "grab spot" after QSO
[x] Add contest name to Header of ADIF file (suggested by SP3RXO)
[ ] Refactor write_adif function. Use an add_adif_field() helper and also 
    already existing get_next_record() function.
[x] Fix arrlsections, paccmults and spdxmults (drop '-end-' marker)
[ ] Do a complete rescore after delete of QSO automatically
[x] document use of CT9.91 CTY.DAT files in FAQ
[ ] Have a template for cabrillo file header  (Joop PG4I)
[ ] Add a keyword to startup TLF in S&P mode (should be an easy one)
[ ] switch between ESM and CT mode during contest (Nate N0NB)
[ ] Send Morse via Hamlib for radios that support it.

[ ] Do a complete rewrite of display related code in the long term to
    allow vertical AND horizontal resizing.


Internals
~~~~~~~~~
[ ] Factor out helper functions to parse parts of logline (band, mode, ...)
[ ] change internal QSO representation to structs (makes coding much
    simpler and will enable migration of log file to a different format
    later)

[ ] Switch the logfile to a database. The actual TR-Log format has some
    limitations. Log as a database will enable easy statistics, make
    removal of QSOs easier and allows us to store more information about
    the contest. (Long term goal)

[ ] Do a major rework of scoring of multis and points (That is already 
    overdue for some time now). As contests developed in last years there
    are more and more complex scoring schemes. To code a special contest
    module for each contest will not be possible with our limited man
    power. So we need a flexible and programmable scoring which will
    allow us to handle most of the contests by a rule file.
    I fear it will break compatibility with existing TLF rules
    completely and would sure be a major version bump to TLF-2.0 or
    similar.

[ ] Rework (and repair) the voice keyer so that Esc could stop the 
    voice keyer. At the moment the voice file is passed to a script 
    so once that happens Tlf loses control.  Perhaps even something as simple
    as getting the PID of the script, if possible, and killing it directly.
    This may have unintended side effects so would require much testing.
    Another thought is to deliver the file to ALSA or Pulse Audio directly and
    be able to stop playback at will.

WISHLIST (N0NB)
~~~~~~~~
[ ] Incorporate some method of pull-down menus for configuration.  i
    Doing so might encourage more use of Tlf?  I don't know if that amount
    of work would be productive or not.
    ALTERNATIVE (suggested by N7DA)
    What about a 2nd application, 'tlf-config' or 'easy-tlf-config', which
    would have the pulldown menus etc for setting up config files.  

[ ] Along with the above, move away from log_cfg.dat and 
    the rules files toward configuration through the UI and a common
    config file that doesn't require hand editing.
