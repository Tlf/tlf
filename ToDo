Planned improvements for TLF-1.4 release
----------------------------------------

[x] make hamlib mandatory (finished Oct 2018, tnx Zoli)
[ ] switch to hamlib's freq_t for frequencies ( and maybe factor out
    hamlib stuff to a separate module )
[ ] allow vertical resizing of tlf (more room for cluster messages)
[ ] drop 'SCAN' menu with noise bridge, panorama scan and smeter
    display (It did not work for a long time and I think no one is
    using it)
[ ] Handling multiplier aliases (see thread started by Nate in June)
[ ] automatically switch back to 'Run' mode from "grab spot" after QSO
[ ] Allow other callmaster databases (hardcoded or by CALLMASTER= keyword)
[ ] Rework startup display for better readability by user

Planned for later versions
--------------------------

[ ] Do a complete rewrite of display related code in the long term to
    allow vertical AND horizontal resizing.
