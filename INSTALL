Tlf now comes with automake and autoconf.
Starting with TLF-1.0.0 you need pkg-config too.

Easiest way to install tlf is by typing:

./configure
make
make install

If you want to compile tlf from the repo, please do a 

autoreconf --install

before the above commands.

If support for Hamlib (>=1.2.8) is wanted, use ./configure --enable-hamlib

By default, tlf will install into /usr/local/bin, together with the
shell-scripts in the scripts directory. Data files will install into
/usr/local/share/tlf.

If you want to change any of these paths, you can do this with the
configure script, e.g. './configure --prefix=/usr --datadir=/usr/share'
will install tlf and scipts into /usr/bin, datafiles into /usr/share/tlf.

See doc/README for more details.
