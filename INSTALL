Tlf now comes with automake and autoconf.
Starting with TLF-1.0.0 you need pkg-config too.

Build Dependencies
------------------

Building TLF requires some other components to be installed before. 
It depends on

 * the _Hamlib_ library for controlling your radio,
 * _ncurses_ and _tinfo_ for text screen handling,
 * the _XMLRPC_C_ library for communication with programs like _FlDigi_ and
 * _Glib-2.0_ for supporting C functions.

If you are using a distribution of the _Debian_ family make sure to install
also the needed header files with

----
sudo apt install libglib2.0-dev libhamlib-dev libncurses5-dev libtinfo-dev
libxmlrpc-core-c3-dev
----

While not a strict build dependency installing the following packages is
helpful too:

 * _sox_ for audio signal handling during SSB contests and
 * _xplanet_ which allows you to see the latest DX spots on the globe.


Quick Install
-------------

The easiest way to install tlf is by typing:

----
./configure
make
make install
----


If you want to compile tlf from the repo, please do a 

----
autoreconf --install
----

before the above commands.


By default, tlf will install into /usr/local/bin, together with the
shell-scripts from the scripts directory. Data files will install into
/usr/local/share/tlf.

If you want to change any of these paths, you can do this with the
configure script too, e.g. './configure --prefix=/usr --datadir=/usr/share'
will install tlf and scripts into /usr/bin, datafiles into /usr/share/tlf.


If you are doing a lot of contesting in digimodes using Fldigi there is support for reading the audio frequency via xmlrpc. Make sure to install XMLRPC-c and configure tlf with

----
./configure --enable-fldigi-xmlrpc
----
