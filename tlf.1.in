.\" Tips for formatting with the roff man macros.  Borrowed from the Vim nroff
.\" help text.
.\"
.\" In order to obtain the best formatted output g/troff can give you, you
.\" should follow a few simple rules about spacing and punctuation.
.\"
.\" 1. Do not leave empty spaces at the end of lines.
.\"
.\" 2. Leave one space and one space only after an end-of-sentence period,
.\"    exclamation mark, etc.
.\"
.\" 3. For reasons stated below, it is best to follow all period marks with a

.\"
.\" The reason behind these unusual tips is that g/n/troff have a line breaking

.\" In addition, these tips aid vertical spacing.
.\"
.\" 1. Start all sentences on a new line.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.
.B @PACKAGE_NAME@
is a console (ncurses) mode general purpose
.SM CW
keyer, logging and contest program for amateur radio operators.
.
It supports the
.SM CQWW,
.SM WPX,
.SM ARRL-DX,
.SM ARRL-FD,
.SM STEWPERRY,
.SM PACC,
.SM FOC Marathon
and
.SM EU SPRINT
contests as well as a lot more basic contests, general QSO and DXpedition mode.
.
It interfaces with a Morse Code generator, a number of radios via the
.B Hamlib
library, and with a
.B "DX Cluster"
via telnet or packet radio.
.
@PACKAGE_NAME@ can project DX cluster data into the excellent Xplanet program,
written by Hari Nair.
.
.P
Contest operation mimics the popular
.B TR-Log
program for DOS, the output file is TR-Log compatible.
.
The log can be exported in
.SM ADIF
or
.B Cabrillo 3.0
format.
.
.P
The program was written for console mode on purpose, which allows it to run on
smaller machines, or remotely via
.SM SSH
or a modem link.
.
.P
CW keying via
.B cwdaemon
is fully supported, featuring direct mode for the keyboard and output to
parallel and serial ports and speed and weight control from the keyboard, and
band info output on the parallel port.
Likewise, CW keying via
.B Hamlib
is supported for rigs that feature the capability. Tlf can set the CW speed,
and at the same time read back the speed if changed using the knob on the rig.
.
.P
For users of the K1EL series of \(lqWin Keyers\(rq, the
.B winkeydaemon
is available from
.UR https://github.com/N0NB/winkeydaemon
GitHub
.UE .
.
Setup is the same as for
.BR cwdaemon (1).
.
.P
For radio control @PACKAGE_NAME@ works with Hamlib (version >= 1.2.8), you
can find it at
.UR https://www.hamlib.org/
www.hamlib.org
.UE .
.
.P
@PACKAGE_NAME@ provides full
.SM TCP/IP
networking between @PACKAGE_NAME@ nodes, syncing/distributing log, packet
data, frequency data, local talk, serial numbers, time sync etc.
.
.

When @PACKAGE_NAME@ starts, it looks for
.I YOURCALL.cbr
file in the current directory, reads the configuration and rule files, and
based on the current setup generates the log(s).
.
If the contest is WAE and you have QTCs in Cabrillo, then @PACKAGE_NAME@
generates the QTC logfiles.
.
@PACKAGE_NAME@ will not write over the existing log(s).
.
.IP
The generated import will be
.IR IMPORT_CONTEST.log ,
where the CONTEST is the name of contest in the config.
.
If QTC exists, then the files
.I IMPORT_QTC_sent.log
and
.I IMPORT_QTC_recv.log
will be created.

.
.
.SH USAGE
.
@PACKAGE_NAME@ has been written for
.BR "console mode" \.
.
If you want to run @PACKAGE_NAME@ from a terminal in
.B X
or
.BR Wayland ,
you will probably get the best results if you set \fBTERM\fR=\fIlinux\fR and
use a Linux console terminal.
.
Both KDE and GNOME terminals have a facility to start a Linux console in an X
terminal as does Xfce-terminal.
.
.P
By default,
.BR xterm (1)
or
.BR urxvt (1)
may give unreadable colours.
.
If so, you will have to set different colours in
.I logcfg.dat
or prepare
.I $HOME/.Xresources
to the preferred colour scheme (a sample Xresources file that contains usage
instructions is included in the doc directory).
.
One advantage of xterm or urxvt are that they do not consume the
.B F11
key which other terminal emulators reserve for full screen mode nor
.BR Ctrl\-PgUp / Ctrl\-PgDn
which may be used for tab switching in other emulators.
.
.P
Recent efforts have resulted in improved keyboard handling.
.
If you find keys that do not work, the developers would like to receive your
report of which keys and which terminal have the problem.
.
Please send the report to the mailing list shown in the
.B BUGS
section below.
.
.P
There are excellent results with the latest KDE, GNOME, and Xfce terminal
emulators (vi colours are preferred by some).
.
As @PACKAGE_NAME@ uses ncurses to format its display you must use a proper
font.
.
(Good choices are the Linux font, Inconsolata, Hack, or any monospace font that
dots or slashes the zero character).
.
If you have problems, try the linux text console first and work from there.
.
.P
Normally you start or restart @PACKAGE_NAME@ in fast mode with
\(lq\fB@PACKAGE@\fR\(rq.
.
During debugging of a
.I logcfg.dat
file you can start in verbose mode, to have a look at the startup messages.
The config file can also be specified on command line:
.
.IP
.EX
@PACKAGE@ \-f config_file
.EE
.
.P
If you have the packet cluster enabled you will first see the packet screen
(if you are using telnet and you have provided your callsign in
.IR logcfg.dat \,
you will be automatically logged in switched to the main logging screen).
.
Log in with your callsign, if needed, and switch to the main logging screen
with the \(oq:\(cq command.
.
You can come back to the packet screen later with the
.BR :PAC ket
command from the call input field of the main logging screen.
.
.P
You can exit and close @PACKAGE_NAME@ with the
.BR :EXI t
or
.BR :QUI t
commands or with
.BR Alt\-X \.
.
.P
At restart @PACKAGE_NAME@ recalculates the score, which may take some time
depending on the number of QSOs in the logfile and the speed of your system.
.
@PACKAGE_NAME@ takes the points as they are in the log, and calculates the
multiplier from either callsign or exchange field (depending on the contest).
.
.
.SH COMMANDS
.
These commands are entered in the
.B callsign
field of the main logging screen.
.
Each command consists of the leading \(oq:\(cq and at minimum the upper case
characters of the command name plus any needed parameters separated by
\(oqSpace\(cq.
.
.TP
.BR :ADI f
Writes the log to an Amateur Data Interchange Format (ADIF) file
.IR logfile.adif \.
.
.TP
.BR :CHA r
Input the number of characters for CW auto-start or \(oqm\(cq for manual
start.
.
Possible values are: \(oq0\(cq (off), \(oq2\(cq...\(oq5\(cq or \(oqm\(cq
(manual).
.
.IP
After typing as many characters in the input field or after pressing the
\(oqEnter\(cq key in manual mode @PACKAGE_NAME@ starts sending the callsign
without further keystrokes.
.
You can type in the rest of the call (but quickly).
.
As soon as the sending catches your last typed character @PACKAGE_NAME@
automatically sends the exchange and the cursor jumps to the exchange field.
.
.IP
\(oqEscape\(cq stops sending.
.
.IP
This works only in CW contests in RUN mode.

.TP
.BR :SOU nd
.
Opens the sound recorder menu.
.
.IP
The sound recorder is a utility for recording the voice keyer messages and
enables recording a complete contest in chunks of 1 hour to the hard drive.
.
.IP
Using the sound recorder requires the installation of the
.BR sox (1)
package, which provides the
.B rec
utility used by the script.
.
.IP
For recording voice messages, the keys
.BR F1 \(en F12\c
.RB ,\  s ,\ or\  c
will record the voice keyer message for that key.
.
.IP
The sound recorder uses the
.I @prefix@/bin/soundlog
script which should already be installed to a location in the
.IR $PATH .
.
The recording is written to the
.I $HOME/@PACKAGE@/soundlogs
directory.
.
.IP
The
.I soundlog
script now defaults to the
.I rec
utility provided with the Sox package.
.
The command syntax is not compatible with the previous default
.I rec
utility.
.
.IP
The previous default
.I rec
utility is assumed to be from the Open Sound System (OSS) package (sound
system used on Linux prior to ALSA).
.
Its default soundcard device is
.IR /dev/dsp .
.
Use the
.B SC_DEVICE
parameter in the
.I logcfg.dat
file to specify the correct device.
.
To enable the OSS version uncomment the needed line in the
.I soundlog
script and comment the Sox
.I rec
line.
.
.IP
The recorded file extension is
.IR .au ,
the Sun \[*m]\(enlaw format.
.
.IP
The recorder produces less than 60 MegaBytes per hour in single channel mode.
.
Recording a complete 48 hour CQWW event requires less than 3 GigaBytes of disk
space.
.
If local disk space must be preserved, the sound file can be moved to another
host using FTP, rsync, scp, or any other network transfer protocol.

.
.IP
The file is created in the current directory as
.I YOURCALL.cbr
(with slashes as part of YOURCALL converted to underscores, such as
WX9XYZ/8.cbr to WX9XYZ_8.cbr).
.
.
.SH KEYS
.
Work has been ongoing to unify the key map between the Linux text console and
the various X terminals.
.
It may be slightly different on certain X terminals depending on which keys
they consume for their own use.
.
Turn off any key recognition by the terminal for its own purposes (menu
access, help display, etc.) if possible.
.
Pay special attention to the F1-F12 and Alt-<\fIchar\fR> keys.
.
Moreover, on some systems you must set the \fBTERM\fR=\fIlinux\fR or
\fBTERM\fR=\fIrxvt\fR environment variable, although variables such as
.IR xterm ,
.IR xterm-color,
or
.I xterm-256color
should work.
.
.\" What works under VNC???
This also works under VNC.
.
.P
Certain key combinations will probably not be useable as the Linux console
consumes Alt-F1 through
.RI Alt-F x
(often F7, but could be greater) for switching its virtual consoles.
.
Likewise, the various desktop environments consume key combinations for their
own use.
.
Ctrl-F1 through
.RI Ctrl-F x
are used to switch desktop workspaces.
.RI Alt-F x
combinations are used for various desktop features and are unavailable
for @PACKAGE_NAME@ use.
.
.P
Some desktop terminal emulators are capable of being configured to allow the
application running in them to get all of the keys the desktop environment
does not consume.
.
In testing good choices seem to be Gnome Terminal, Rox Terminal, or the
classic Xterm (although its default color presentation differs slightly from
the Linux console and other terminal emulators) or URxvt (with a very distinct
default color palette).
.
Xfce Terminal is known to consume F11 and Ctrl-PageUp and Ctrl-PageDown.
.
The @PACKAGE_NAME@ developers have implemented Alt-PageUp and Alt-PageDown as
a work-around for the Ctrl counterparts.
.
Reports of success with other terminals are welcome.
.
.SS Call Input and Exchange Fields
.
The Call Input and Exchange Fields are the two main entry fields of
@PACKAGE_NAME@ where the majority of the keyboard entry takes place.
.
The call input field is active when @PACKAGE_NAME@ completes its
initialization and presents the main screen.
.
.P
Most key sequences are the same in both fields.
.
Differences are noted as necessary.
.
.TP
.BR A-Z ,\  0-9 ,\  /
.BR Call\ input :
ASCII letters, numerals, and the
.B /
character that make up an internationally recognized amateur radio callsign
plus temporary location identifiers.

as ARRL Field Day and ARRL Sweepstakes.
.
.TP
.B Space
Switches from call input to exchange field.
.
.IP
Separates exchange field elements when multiple exchange elements must be
entered, such as ARRL Field Day and ARRL Sweepstakes.
.
.TP
.B Tab
Switch between call input and exchange fields (jump back to call input from
exchange field).
.
.TP
.B Enter
Smart key depending on contest mode.
.
.IP
@PACKAGE_NAME@ follows the TR operating style which has two modes,
.B CQ
and
.B S&P
(Search and Pounce).
.
.IP
.B CQ
mode is used for \(lqrunning\(rq, that is staying on one frequency and
having other stations answer your call.
.
.IP
.B S&P
mode is for tuning up or down the band and answering the calls of other
stations.
.
.IP
.B In CQ Mode:
.RS 7
.
.IP \(bu 2
With the call input field empty,
.B Enter
sends the
.B F12
message (Auto CQ).
.
.IP \(bu 2
With characters in the call input field,
.B Enter
answers the calling station by sending the
.B F3
message (RST) and moves the cursor to the exchange field.
.
.IP \(bu 2
If the exchange field is empty,
.B Enter
repeats the
.B F3
message (RST).
.
.IP \(bu 2
After the exchange information received from the other station is entered,
.B Enter
sends the
.B CQ_TU_MSG
message if defined, or \(lqTU\(rq (CW mode) and your call otherwise.
.
Afterwards it logs the QSO, and returns the cursor to the call input field to
answer the next call.

.IP \(bu 2
When the call input field has been filled,
.B Enter
sends the
.B S&P_CALL_MSG
if defined, or your call otherwise.
.
Afterwards it moves the cursor to the exchange field.

.IP \(bu 2
Once the exchange has been received,
.B Enter
sends the
.B S&P_TU_MSG
if defined, otherwise it sends your call followed by the
.B F3
message (RST).

.SS CT Compatible Mode
.
@PACKAGE_NAME@ has limited support for the logging sequence keys used in the
once popular
.B CT
logging program.
.
Unlike the default
.I Enter \ Sends \ Message
.RB ( ESM )
mode, the CT Compatible mode uses the
.B Insert
and
.B +
keys in the logging sequence and
.B Enter
logs a complete QSO.
.
Unlike ESM mode, CT mode does not have separate
.B CQ
or
.B S&P
modes.
.
.P
CT Compatible mode is enabled with the
.B CTCOMPATIBLE
keyword in
.I logcfg.dat
(see the
.B PREFERENCES
section below).
.
.P
The following keys differ in behavior in CT Compatible mode.
.
.TP
.B Enter
Log the complete QSO without sending any message macro.
.
.IP
If the callsign field is empty, pressing
.B Enter
will activate the
.B Auto-CQ
function.
.
If the exchange field is empty, pressing
.B Enter
in either the callsign or exchange field will result in no action.
.
.TP
.B Insert
Send the
.B RST
(F3) macro.
.
.IP
Since the
.B RST
macro includes the other station's callsign by default, the
.B HIS
macro is not sent first.
.
This differs from classic CT, but is a compromise to use the default
@PACKAGE_NAME@ macros.
.
.TP
.BR + \ (Plus)
Send the
.B TU
macro and log the QSO.
.
.IP
The
.B +
key checks if the exchange field is empty and if it is nothing is sent or
logged.
.
In rare cases where nothing needs to be entered in the exchange field, such as
when working DX from USA in ARRL 160, simply enter a space to allow the
.B +
key to send the
.B TU
message and log the QSO.
.
.TP
.B Alt-V
Change CW speed.

.SH PREFERENCES
.
@PACKAGE_NAME@ can be fully configured by editing the
.I logcfg.dat
file.
.
Normally you keep one
.I logcfg.dat
file, setting up your callsign, the log file name, the ports and addresses for
packet, the radio, the network etc., and a separate rules file per contest.
.
.P
The
.I logcfg.dat
file can be edited from within @PACKAGE_NAME@ by the
.BR :CFG \ or \ :SET
commands (or with any other plain text editor before starting @PACKAGE_NAME@).
.
It contains keyword-argument pairs, one per line.
.
Lines starting with \(lq#\(rq and empty lines are interpreted as comments and
are ignored.
.
.P
You can set your favourite editor in the

.TP
.B IGNOREDUPE
Enables logging multiple QSOs in a contest with the same station (considered a
good idea these days as contest bots that parse the submitted Cabrillo file
will determine such dupes (duplicate contacts)).
.
.TP
\fBSUNSPOTS\fR=\fISSN\fR
Set the
.I sunspots number
value which is used to do a rough calculation of the MUF (Maximum Usable
Frequency).
.
.IP
If the cluster interface is used the SSN will be updated by WWV or WCY
messages.
.
.\" FIXME: Describe how this relates to SUNSPOTS.
.TP
\fBSFI\fR=\fISolar_flux_value\fR
Set SFI used to calculate SSN.
.
.IP
The SSN value is used to do a rough calculation of the MUF.
.
If the packet interface is used the SSN will be updated by WWV or WCY
messages.
.
.TP
.B CHANGE_RST
If set in logcfg.dat,
.B PgUp
and
.B PgDown
will change sent/received RST instead of CW speed if you are in call/exchange
field and call field is not empty.

.IP
Default is these keys only change CW speed.
.
.TP
\fBCHANGE_RST\fR=\fI33, 43, 47, 499, ...\fR
Provide a comma separated list of RS(T) values which are used for the sent RST.
.
.IP
Received RST will always be 33\(en39, 43\(en49, or 53\(en59.
.
.IP
Providing a value for T is optional but will be ignored.
.
.IP
In CW and DIGI modes T will always be 9.
.
.TP
.B NOB4
Do not send automatic \(lqQSO B4\(rq message.
.
.IP
Default is to send such messages.
.
.TP
.B NOAUTOCQ
No automatic CQ when pressing
.B Enter
or
.BR F12 .
.
.IP
Default is that these keys will start an automatic CQ (see their descriptions
in the
.B KEYS
section above).
.
.TP
.B SEND_DE
Sends a \(lqDE\(rq word before your callsign, as in \(lqDE W1AW\(rq.
.
.IP
There is a special case; if
.B SEND_DE
is present in
.IR logcfg.dat ,
and @PACKAGE_NAME@ if is in
.BR :DIG imode,
then the other station's callsign will be sent before \(lqDE\(rq, such as
\(lqDL1A DE W1AW\(rq.
.
.SH RULES
.
The contest rules can be put into separate files.
.
@PACKAGE_NAME@ will first look for a directory called
.I rules/
in the working directory, and a file named for the contest, for example,
.IR cqww .
.
If @PACKAGE_NAME@ cannot find such a file, it will look into the directory
.IR @prefix@/share/@PACKAGE@/rules .
.
A rules file contains contest specific parameters like multipliers, scoring
rules, CW and voice keyer messages, etc.
.
.P
.BR Note :
The rules file overrides settings from the
.I logcfg.dat
file!
.
.P
.B WARNING!
It is your own responsibility to try these rules well BEFORE the contest.
.
The authors of @PACKAGE_NAME@ cannot possibly check all rules for all
contests :) and during the contest there is normally no time to fix it.
.
Of course, Murphy's Law always applies!
.
These commands can generally appear in any order.
.
.SS RULES Configuration
.
General configuration options for the
.B RULES
file.
.
.TP
\fBCONTEST\fR=\fIxxxxx\fR
Name of the contest (same as the file name
.I contest_rules_filename
given to the
.B RULES
parameter referenced above in
.IR logcfg.dat ).
.
Some contests, like CQWW and WPX, are pre-programmed.
.
Look for the relevant rules file in
.IR @prefix@/share/@PACKAGE@/rules .
.
.TP
\fBLOGFILE\fR=\fIlog_file_name\fR
Mandatory!
.
.IP
By convention
.IR contest_rules_filename.log ,
but can be anything meaningful.
.
.TP
\fBCABRILLO\fR=\fIformat\fR
Specify the name of the Cabrillo QSO and QTC line format.
.
For most cases
.I UNIVERSAL
is a good choice.
.
For further Cabrillo related information see
.B CABRILLO CONFIGURATION
below.
.
.TP
.B CONTEST_MODE
Sets @PACKAGE_NAME@ into contest mode.
.
.IP
Do not use this parameter for normal QSO logging!
.
.TP
.B SHORT_SERIAL
Uses short form for serial number (9=N, 0=T).
.
.TP
.B LONG_SERIAL
Uses long form for serial number (default).
.
.TP
.B NO_RST
Do not use RST in contest, such as for CW Open, ARRL Sweepstakes, ARRL Field
Day, or various QSO parties and such events.
.
.IP
In such a case when writing a Cabrillo log format template you must provide a
conforming format definition without RST values.
.
.TP
.B MIXED
Stations can be worked in any mode (CW, SSB and DIG) on a given band
without being counted as a DUPE.
.
.TP
.B SSBMODE
Start @PACKAGE_NAME@ in SSB mode.
.
.IP
If radio control is active, the radio will be placed in SSB mode, if not in
SSB mode already.
.
Normally @PACKAGE_NAME@ starts in CW mode and will set the radio to CW mode if
needed.
.
.IP
.BR Note :
At this time @PACKAGE_NAME@ does not follow mode changes on the radio.
.
When switching modes use the
.BR :CW ,
.BR :SSB ,
or
.BR :DIG
commands to set both @PACKAGE_NAME@ and the radio mode.
.
.TP
.B CQWW_M2
Put the node ID into the logline (just after the QSO number) to support
Multi/2 operation where the station logging the QSO must be in the Cabrillo
file.
.
This can also be used for M/1 and M/M, to enable post-contest analysis of the
nodes.
.
.TP
\fBFKEY-HEADER\fR=\fI"short description of your defined F-keys"\fR
The actual F-key assignments shown on the top of the main logging screen.
.
Maximum length is 59.
.
The default is:
\(lq1=CQ\ \ 2=DE\ \ 3=RST\ 4=73\ \ 5=HIS\ \ 6=MY\ \ 7=B4\ \ \ 8=AGN\ \ 9=?\(rq
.
.TP
\fBTUNE_SECONDS\fR=\fItuning-seconds\fR
Specify how many seconds you allow tune (Alt-T) remain active before
automatically terminating transmit.
.
.IP
Range: 1\(en100.
.
.IP
The default value is
.IR 6,
to maintain compatibility with previous TLF versions.
.
After 100 seconds, tuning will automatically be terminated, to allow your PA
(and perhaps you too ;-) ) to cool down a bit...
.
.TP
.B CALLMASTER\fR=\fIcallmaster\fR
Use a different file name as the callmaster database
(default is
.I callmaster
in the working directory).
.
.IP
Often downloaded as
.I MASTER.SCP
from the Supercheck Partials Web site.
.
See the
.B PARTIALS
and
.B USEPARTIALS
commands in the
.B User Interface Commands
section above and the
.B FILES
section below for obtaining Supercheck Partials updates.
.
.TP
.B BMAUTOGRAB
If set along with the
.B RADIO_CONTROL
and
.B BANDMAP
(mandatory for this parameter) options, @PACKAGE_NAME@ will grab the callsign
from the bandmap, if the TRX (radio) frequency is equal with the displayed
bandmap frequency.
.
.\" FIXME: To what is the call added?
.TP
.B BMAUTOADD
If set along with the
.B RADIO_CONTROL
and
.B BANDMAP
(mandatory for this parameter) options, @PACKAGE_NAME@ will add the callsign
from callsign field, if at least 3 characters have been entered.
.
.IP
Use \(lqS\(rqkip dupes in BANDMAP settings to control if it should also grab
dupes.
.
.TP
.B SPRINTMODE
If set, @PACKAGE_NAME@ will automatically switch its mode between LOG and S&P
after every QSO.
.
.TP
.B FLDIGI
If you work RTTY (or any other digital modes), you can communicate with Fldigi
through
.BR XMLRPC .
.
This parameter activates the interface.
.
.IP
By default @PACKAGE_NAME@ connects to:
.
.IP
.UR http://localhost:7362/RPC2
http://localhost:7362/RPC2
.UE .
.
.IP
If you run Fldigi's XMLRPC server on an different port use
\fBFLDIGI\fR=\fIhttp://localhost:port_#/RPC2\fR
.
.TP
\fBMINITEST\fR[=\fINNN\fR]
Use this option when the contest is a minitest like contest.
.
.IP
In such contests the full contest interval is divided into shorter sections
(e.g. 6 * 10 minute sections in an hour).
.
Any station can be worked once in each of the time sections without counting
as a dupe.
.
The default length of the sections is 600 seconds (10 minutes), but you can
pass another value (in seconds) after the \(oq=\(cq sign.
.
.IP
There must be an integral number of time sections per hour!
.
.SS CW, Digimode and Voice Keyer Macros
.
The following parameters configure the CW, Digimode and voice mode keyer
message macros.
.
.TP
.B Macro characters in the message strings
.B %

.B PORTABLE_MULT_2
Multiply points x2 for portable stations (e.g. R1 field day).
.
.TP
.B LOWBAND_DOUBLE
Double all points for lowband (40, 80, and 160m) QSOs (can be combined with
any other value).
.
.IP
(Will be deprecated in future! Use BANDWEIGHT_POINTS instead.)
.
.TP
\fBPOWERMULT\fR=\fIpower_multiplier\fR
Use this value to multiply the final points.

.IP
If the contest rule allows one to use the power multiplier (such as Stewperry,
ARRL-FD, various QSO parties), set it here.
.
.IP
.BR Note :
The value type of
.B POWERMULT
is a float, as in \fBPOWERMULT\fR=\fI1.5\fR, but the final score will be
rounded by the C library
.BR floor (3)
function, which gives the largest integer value that is not greater than
multiplied score.
.
.TP
.B WYSIWYG_MULTIBAND
Exchange is the multiplier, per band, whatever you enter.
.
.IP
@PACKAGE_NAME@ builds its own list of multipliers as QSOs are logged.
.
.TP
.B WYSIWYG_ONCE
Exchange is multiplier, whatever you enter.
.
.IP
Counts once per contest, not per band.
.
.TP
.B WAZMULT
Multiplier is the CQ zone (per band).
.
.TP
.B ITUMULT
Multiplier is the ITU zone (per band).
.
.TP
.B PFX_MULT
Multiplier is prefix (PA0, DA2, VE7, etc.).
.
.IP
Counts once per contest, not per band.
.
.\" FIXME: Reference CQ WPX handling elsewhere.  CQ-WW-WPX is confusing as it
.\" is not a parameter keyword and only appears here in the repository.
.TP
.B PFX_MULT_MULTIBAND
Same as WPX, but the WPX only used CQ-WW-WPX, and there a single prefix
multiplier only once, not all band.
.
.IP
With this option, the PFX counts as multiplier on all band.
.
This usable in the All Asia DX contest (AA-DX).
.
.TP
.B COUNTRY_MULT
Multiplier is the DXCC entity (per band).
.
.IP
Relies on a so-called "country" file by AD1C.
.
An outdated version is supplied in
.IR @prefix@/share/@PACKAGE@/cty.dat .
.
See the
.B FILES
section below.
.
.TP
\fBMULT_LIST\fR=\fIfile_name\fR
Name of multipliers file (often sections, provinces, states, counties).
.
.IP
May contain comment lines starting with \(lq#\(rq in the first column.
.
Each multiplier resides on a single line by itself.
.
.IP
Starting from Tlf-1.4 aliases may be defined for the multipliers.
.
Define the aliases as:
.IP
    \fImultiplier:alias1,alias2,alias3\fR
.
.IP
If you log a QSO with one of the aliases it will be counted as the
multiplier.
.
You can have more than one line for the same multiplier.
.
.IP
This is useful for state QSO parties as an instate participant where instate
operators exchange county abbreviations rather than the state but the state
can only count once (Kansas QSO Party is once such example).
.
.TP
.B SECTION_MULT
Multiplier is section from multipliers file.
.
.IP
Counts per band.
.
.TP
.B SECTION_MULT_ONCE
Multiplier is section from multipliers file.
.
.IP
Counts once per contest, not per band.
.
.TP
\fBCONTINENTLIST\fR=\fI"comma separated list of continents"\fR
Valid values are: SA, NA, EU, AF, AS and OC.
.
.TP
\fBCONTINENT_LIST_POINTS\fR=\fId\fR
Points for stations from continents in CONTINENTLIST
.
.TP
.B USE_CONTINENTLIST_ONLY
Score zero points for station from continents not in the list.
.
.TP
.B BANDWEIGHT_POINTS
Define a point weighting factor for different bands.
.
.IP
For example, setting:
.
.IP
    \fBBANDWEIGHT_POINTS\fR=\fI160:3,80:2,40:1,20:1,15:1,10:2\fR
.
.IP
for use in the All Asia DX (AADX) contest will multiply all QSO points by 3 on
160m, by 2 on 80m and 10m and on all other bands only by 1.
.
.IP
Bands not in the list are weighted by 1.
.
.TP
.B BANDWEIGHT_MULTIS
Allow a weighting factor for multipliers on different bands.
.
.IP
For example, setting:
.
.IP
    \fBBANDWEIGHT_MULTIS\fR=\fI80:4,40:3,20:2,15:2,10:2\fR
.
.IP
for use in the Worked All Europe DX Contest (WAEDC) will multiply the number
of multipliers on 80 by 4, on 40 by 3 and on 20/15/10 by 2.
.
.IP
The multiplication is executed after any other multiplier calculation.
.
.IP
Bands not in list will be weighted by 1.
.
.TP
.B PFX_NUM_MULTIS
In WAEDC (and maybe with other contests too) the multipliers are the different
countries, but there are some exceptions where the prefix of certain countries
is a different multiplier.
.
.IP
In WAEDC these countries are: W, VE, VK, ZL, ZS, JA, PY, RA8/RA9 and RAØ.
.
With this option, you can define the country prefixes:
.
.IP
    \fBPFX_NUM_MULTIS\fR=\fIW,VE,VK,ZL,ZS,JA,PY,UA9\fR.
.
.IP
@PACKAGE_NAME@ will read this list, perform a lookup in a countrylist for a
country code, and that code will be used.
.
If you include the UA9 prefix and then make a QSO with a station from Asiatic
Russia, the PFX number will evaluated with a new multiplier, but European
Russia will not.
.
.TP
.B EXCLUDE_MULTILIST
Some contests have a special multipliers list, which is easier to write
by excluding a predefined set.
.
.IP
For example, the main set could be
.BR COUNTRY_MULT ,
and you need to exclude from that list just a few countries, (e.g. the SAC
contest excludes the Scandinavian countries as they are not multipliers).
.
In that case you can use this configuration:
.
.IP
    \fBCOUNTRY_MULT\fR
    \fBCOUNTRYLIST\fR=\fIsac:JW,JX,LA,OF1,OF0,OJ1,OJ0,OX,OW,OZ,SM,TF\fR
    \fBEXCLUDE_MULTILIST\fR=\fICOUNTRYLIST\fR
.
.IP
Another useful example is the WAEDC RTTY contest where all stations can work
each other, however, for EU stations only the non-EU stations are the
multipliers, and the opposite for non-EU stations where only the EU stations
are the multipliers.
.
In that case the EU stations can use this configuration:
.
.IP
    \fBCONTINENTLIST\fR=\fIEU\fR
    \fBCOUNTRY_MULT\fR
    \fBEXCLUDE_MULTILIST\fR=\fICONTINENTLIST\fR
.
.IP
and all countries are multipliers, except for the EU stations.
.
.IP
Also, in this contest the non-EU stations can use this configuration:
.
.IP
    \fBCONTINENTLIST\fR=\fISA,NA,AF,AS,OC\fR
    \fBCOUNTRY_MULT\fR
    \fBEXCLUDE_MULTILIST\fR=\fICONTINENTLIST\fR
.
.IP
and all EU countries are multipliers and not those from the SA, NA, AF, OC and
AS continents, so only the EU stations remain as multipliers.
.
.TP
\fBUNIQUE_CALL_MULTI\fR=\fIALL\fR|\fIBAND\fR
Multiplier is the callsign.
.
.IP
The argument tells @PACKAGE_NAME@, how to score the callsigns as multipliers:
.br
.B ALL
means the callsign is a multiplier once per the contest, independent of band.
.br
.B BAND
means the callsign counts as a multiplier per band.
.
.SS Exchange
The following parameters configure @PACKAGE_NAME@'s handling of the exchange.
.
.TP
.B SERIAL+SECTION
Exchange is serial number and section, multiplier is section from multiplier
file.
.
.IP
Counts per band.
.
.TP
.B SERIAL_OR_SECTION
Exchange is serial number or section.
.
.IP
This option is similar to SERIAL+SECTION, except the exchange could be a
serial OR the section.
.
This option was introduced for HA-DX, where HA stations give the shortest form
of their county, other stations give serial.
.
.TP
.B SERIAL+GRID4
Exchange is serial number and grid (e.g. 001 JO21QI), multiplier is 4-character
grid (JO21).
.
.IP
Counts per band.
.
.TP
.B DX_&_SECTIONS
Multiplier is DXCC country or section from multiplier file.
.
.TP
.B RECALL_MULTS
Exchange can be recycled, will be filled into exchange field when it is known
(see also
.BR INITIAL_EXCHANGE ).
.
.TP
\fBINITIAL_EXCHANGE\fR=\fIexchanges.txt\fR
The file must contain a comma-separated list of exchanges.
.
.IP
If the exchange is the name of the operator, the file should contain lines
like:
.
.IP
    PA0R,rein
.br
    PG4I,joop
.br
    OK1RR,martin
.
.IP
If
.B RECALL_MULTS
is set, @PACKAGE_NAME@ will look in this list for the exchange and fill it in
for you.
.
There are various contests which have a standard exchange, such as the FOC
Marathon.
.
The module also recognises embedded calls (e.g. CT3/PA0R/QRP).
.
.TP
.B CONTINENT_EXCHANGE
Exchange is a continent (NA, SA, EU, AS, AF, OC).
.
.TP
.B SERIAL_EXCHANGE
Exchange is a serial number (formats exchange field).
.
.TP
.B MYQRA
For the \(lqStewperry\(rq contest, this option is used to set the QRA
(Maidenhead) locator, (e.g. JN97, or the full form: JN97OM).
.
.IP
In Stewperry, the points are calculated based on the distance between the
stations as calculated between this setting and the locator entered into the
exchange field.
.
.SS QTC
.
The following parameters configure @PACKAGE_NAME@ for the Worked All Europe DX
Contest (WAEDC) exchange of QTCs.
.
.TP
\fBQTC\fR=\fIdirection\fR
Send or receive QTCs in a contest (usually on WAEDC).
.
.IP
.I direction
is one of: RECV, SEND, BOTH
.
.IP
.BR Note :
Currently just the RECV direction is implemented.
.
For more information, please see the
.I @prefix@/share/doc/@PACKAGE@/README_QTC.txt
file.
.
.TP
\fBQTC_CAP_CALLS\fR=\fIlist_of_qtc_capable_callsigns.txt\fR
Indicate that the station is QTC capable and highlight it in the bandmap or
worked window.
.
.IP
Put the callsigns of such stations in a file in the working directory, one
callsign per line, and give its name as an argument to this parameter.
.
.TP
.B QTC_AUTO_FILLTIME
If you use the QTC feature and you are an EU station in CW or SSB modes, then
you can only RECEIVE the QTCs.
.
.IP
Most sending stations send their QTCs as a short form.
.
For example, after the first line the first two characters of time field are
not sent.
.
.IP
If you set this option, then when you fill the first QTC line, @PACKAGE_NAME@
will fill the other time fields, but only the first two characters.
.
If you change the hour (e.g. if there is a time of 2059 and the next one is
2100), then all next time fields will be changed.
.
.TP
.B QTC_RECV_LAZY
If you use the QTC feature, and you are an EU station in CW or SSB modes, then
you can use this feature.
.
.IP
By default, @PACKAGE_NAME@ validates all received QTC lines (i.e. the time
field must be four characters long; callsign and serial fields must not be
empty).
.
.IP
If you set this parameter, @PACKAGE_NAME@ will not perform validation.
.
.
.SH CABRILLO CONFIGURATION
.
This section covers the configuration of Cabrillo processing.
.
.P
The fields of the generated Cabrillo file can be either
.RS 2
.IP \(bu 2
set to a fixed value,
.IP \(bu
input interactively,
.IP \(bu
or disabled.
.
.P
.BR Note :
A
.I template
file defines the values used in the headers of the Cabrillo file.
.
A
.I format
file defines the fields of the QSO lines in the Cabrillo file.
.
.SS Using a Cabrillo template
.
A Cabrillo template is used to provide station specific values that will be
placed into the generated Cabrillo file.
.
@PACKAGE_NAME@ will not prompt for values listed in this file when the
.B :WRI
command is issued.
.
.P
.BR Note :
The template keywords are the same as the parameters below with the
.B CABRILLO\-
prefix omitted.
.
Cabrillo keyword definitions can be found at the
.UR https://wwrof.org/cabrillo/
World Wide Operators Foundation
.UE
Cabrillo specification page.
.
.TP
\fBCABRILLO\-TEMPLATE\fR=\fIfile.cbr\fR
The specified file is parsed and the values from relevant lines are taken the
same way as if they were added via a config file.
.
.IP
The header, footer, comment and QSO lines are ignored.
.
.IP
One can, for example, re-use a file from a previous contest or use a sample
file provided for the contest.
.
Another possibility is to summarize the station-specific values in a
.I station.cbr
file (see as an example
.IR @prefix@/share/doc/@PACKAGE@/station-sample.cbr ).
.
As multiple
.B CABRILLO\-TEMPLATE
parameters can be specified, it allows for separating the contest and station
specific parts.
.
.IP
This is an optional configuration as the same effect can be reached
by plain configs (via the
.I logcfg.dat
and
.I rules
files).
.
.IP
.BR Note :
The
.B CABRILLO\-
prefix is required in the config files.
.
.SS Internal configuration
.
Following parameters control the generation of QSO lines.
.
.TP
\fBCABRILLO\-EXCHANGE\fR=\fIformat\fR
.
Specifies the sent exchange format.
.
.IP
The hash mark (\(lq#\(rq) stands for QSO serial number.
.
For a contest using a fixed exchange enter the value here (limited to 39
characters).

.TP
\fBCABRILLO\fR=\fIformat\fR
.TQ
\fBCABRILLO\-QSO\-FORMAT\fR=\fIformat\fR
Set the format of QSO and QTC lines including the separator character for the
received exchange.
.
.IP
The format descriptions are contained in
.I cabrillo.fmt
either in the current directory or in
.IR @prefix@/share/@PACKAGE@ .
.
The specified format file is used both to generate Cabrillo output and also
for Cabrillo import.
.
For technical details see
.IR @prefix@/share/doc/@PACKAGE@/README.Cabrillo .
.
.IP
A
.I cabrillo.fmt
format file is used to generate a Cabrillo file when a predefined format in
.I @prefix@/share/@PACKAGE@/cabrillo.fmt
does not exist.
.
For many events the
.B UNIVERSAL
format is adequate, otherwise you'll need to roll your own based on the log
submission rules of the contest organizers.
.
.
.SS Configuring header information
.
Cabrillo header fields can be set using the keywords listed below.
.
The value assigned to the keyword controls the processing of the field:
.RS 2
.IP \(bu 2
value not in parentheses, e.g. \(lq9ACW\(rq taken verbatim,
.
.IP \(bu
value in parentheses, e.g. \(lq(YES,NO)\(rq will be asked interactively, with
the provided text as hint
.
.IP \(bu
a single dash \(rq\-\(lq value disables the field (neither asked nor output)
keeping its value,
.
.IP \(bu
no value (i.e. a keyword without equal sign) just enables the field without
changing its value.
.RE
.
.P
.BR Note :
The order of the headers in the Cabrillo file is fixed and independent of the
order they are present in a config or template file.
.
.SS Header Keywords
.
.BR Note :
These keywords and the internal ones can also be used in a Cabrillo template
just by removing the
.I CABRILLO\-
prefix and using \(rq:\(lq as value separator.

.I @prefix@/share/@PACKAGE@/logcfg.dat
is a recent example of a generic configuration file.
.
@PACKAGE_NAME@ will copy it into the current working directory if it does not
find one there.
.
It is recommended to
.B copy it into the working directory
and edit it to match the contest.
.
.P
It contains, amongst other settings, the name if the rules file, your call,
info about ports for CW keying, packet or rig control, etc. related to your
station.
.
You should test your settings well
.I before
the contest!
.
.P
.I @prefix@/share/@PACKAGE@/rules/contestname
contains the rules of the
various contests.
.
You can easily write one for your favourite contest making
use of the various multiplier and points capabilities.
.
Test it before the
contest and send a message to
.MT tlf-devel@nongnu.org
the @PACKAGE_NAME@ development list
.ME
if anything is wrong (or right!).
.
.P
It contains name of the log file, contest rules, points, multipliers, and
other parameters related to the contest,
.
.P
.I @prefix@/share/@PACKAGE@/cty.dat
contains a flat ASCII database of info about countries.

Save the
.I master.scp
file as
.I callmaster
in the working directory (or use \fBCALLMASTER\fR=\fImaster.scp\fR to use
the default file name).
.
It will take precedence over the system installed
.I callmaster
file which islikely well out of date.
.
.P
.I Section files
contain a flat ASCII database of multipliers like states, sections, provinces,
districts, names, ages, etc.
