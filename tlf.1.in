.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBtlf\fR
is a console (ncurses) mode general purpose CW keyer, -logging and -contest
program for hamradio. It supports the CQWW, the WPX, the ARRL-DX , the ARRL-FD,
the PACC and the EU SPRINT contests as well as a lot more basic contests,
general QSO and DXpedition mode. It interfaces with a morse code generator, a
number of radios via the hamlib library, and with a DX Cluster. Tlf can project DX cluster data into
the excellent Xplanet program, written by Hari Nair.
.P
Contest operation mimics the popular TR-Log program for DOS, the output file is 
TRlog-compatible. The log can be exported in ADIF or cabrillo format.
.P
The program was written for console mode on purpose, to make it run also on 
smaller machines, or remotely via ssh or a modem link. 
.P
Since tlf-0.9.21 the cwdaemon-0.9 is fully supported, featuring direct mode
for the keyboard and output to parallel and serial ports and speed and weight
control from the keyboard, and band info output on the parallel port.
.P
For rig control tlf works with Hamlib (v. >=1.2.3), you can find it at Sourceforge.com.
.P
Tlf provides full ip networking between tlf nodes,
syncing/distributing log, packet data, frequency data, local talk, serial
numbers, time sync etc...
.P

.SH "USAGE"
.TR
Tlf has been written for \fBconsole mode\fR. If you want to run tlf from a
terminal in X, you will probably get the best results if you set TERM=linux and use
an linux console terminal. Both KDE and GNOME terminals have a facility to start
an X linux console. An Xterm will give unreadable colours, you will have to set
different colours in the logcfg.dat file. Also F1 does not work in Xterm, which is
not compatible with linux consoles. Other keys (sometimes F4 and F5) may not work
in your xterm, YMMV.
There are excellent results with the latest KDE and GNOME consoles (I prefer vi colours).
As tlf uses ncurses to format its display you must use a proper font. (The Linux font
works o.k. ). If you have problems, try the linux text console first and work from there...

Normally you start or restart tlf in fast mode with \fBtlf\fR. During debugging
of a logcfg.dat file you can start in verbose mode, to have a look at the
startup messages. From version tlf-0.9.3 you can load different config files with
\fBtlf -f<filename>\fR.

If you have the packet cluster enabled you will first see the packet screen. Log in with your callsign and switch to tlf with \fB:<enter>\fR. You can come back to the packet screen later with the same command from the call input field.

You can stop tlf with the \fB:EXIT\fR command, the \fB:QUIT\fR command or with \fBCtrl-c\fR, \fBAlt-q\fR or \fBAlt-x\fR.

At restart tlf recalculates the score, which may take some time depending on the
number of qso's in the logfile and the speed of your system. Tlf takes the
points as they are in the log, and calculates the multiplier from either
callsign or exchange field (depending on the contest).

.SH "COMMANDS"

.TR
.B :ADIf
writes adif file (*.adif)

.TR
.B :CHAr 
Input number of characters for CW auto-start. Possible values are 2..5, default is 0 (off).
After typing as many characters in the input field TLF starts sending the callsign without further keystrokes. You can type in the rest off the call (but quickly). As soon as you stop typing (atm for 0.7s) TLF automatically send the exchange and the cursor jumps to the exchange field. ESC stops sending.
This works only in CW CONTEST in RUN mode.

.TR
.B :SIMulator
Toggle simulator mode. In simulator mode you can work a complete
CQWW CW contest in TRlog mode. Set CONTEST=cqww.

.TR
.B :SOUnd
The SOUND recorder is a utility to record the voice keyer messages and enables you to record the complete contest in chunks of 1 hour to the hard drive. It does this in the directory:
~/tlf/soundlogs. The sound recorder uses a script called
.B soundlog
which has to be located in ~/tlf/soundlogs. You find it in the
.B scripts
directory. If your soundcard is different from /dev/dsp you can use the
.B SC_DEVICE
parameter in the logcfg.dat file (my soundcard is at SC_DEVICE=/dev/dsp1).
The file extension is .au, the sun ulaw format. The recorder produces < 60 MB per hour.
This means you can record a complete cqww in less than 3 GB. If your disk cannot handle this, ftp the soundfile to a server every hour....
.P
.B F1 ... F12, s, c
will record the voice keyer message for that key.
.P
1:	Start contest recording to ddhhmm.au
.P
2:	Stop contest recording
.P
3:	Play back contest recording ddhh[mm][xx]

	xx is the offset from the start of the file e.g.:

	2110 will start from beginning of the day 21 hr 10:00 file.

	21100013:00 will start from day 21, hh 10, mm 00, + 13 minutes: 0 seconds

To make sure you get a new file every hour make a cron job to run every hour with:

.B /usr/bin/pkill -f sox > /dev/null 2> /dev/null


If you run this job every 10 minutes you get sound records of 10 minutes long.
.P
Once started the recorder will run until the lock file
.B ~/.VRlock
is removed.



.TR
.B :SYNc
Synchronize the logfile of this node with the logfile pointed to by parameter SYNCFILE=<user:password@host/dir/logfile>. Tlf will wget the logfile from the relevant node, make a dated backup of your local logfile, and merge the 2 files. The score will be recalculated.

.TR
.B :TONe 
Set PC sidetone frequency (300 - 900, 0 = Off)

.TR
.B :TRXcontrol
toggle trxcontrol on/off (default off, only makes sense with rigcontrol capability)

.TR
.B :VIEw 
View the log with LESS

.TR
.B :WRIte 
Write cabrillo file according to specified format (see \fBCABRILLO=\fR 
statement).

.SH "KEYS"

The keymap refers to the linux text console. It may be slightly different on X terminals. Turn off any key recognition by the terminal for its own purposes (menu access, help display, ....). Pay special attention to the Fx- and Alt- keys.

.SH "PREFERENCES"
.TR
Tlf can be fully configured by editing the logcfg.dat file. Normally you keep one
logcfg.dat file, setting up your call, the logfilename, the ports and addresses for
packet, the rig, the network etc., and a separate rules file per contest.
The logcfg.dat file can be edited from within tlf by the \fB:CFG\fR or \fB:SET\fR commands. 
You can set your favourite  editor (joe | vi | e3 | MC) in the logcfg.dat file.
You connect the rules file by using the statement RULES=<contestname> in logcfg.dat.
Tlf will first look in the working directory for a logcfg.dat file, and if it cannot find
one it will look in @prefix@/share/@PACKAGE@. Make sure you edit the logcfg.dat file to
hold your call and your preferred system configuration.

.SH "LOGCFG.DAT statements"
.TR
.TR
.B RULES=<contest rules file>
Name of the rules file to load. It helps if you name the rules file according to the
contest you want to describe.

.TR
.B SYNCFILE=user:password@host/dir/syncfile (wget syntax).
File on remote host you want to synchronize with.

.TR
.B CTCOMPATIBLE
Does not use the TRlog qso sequence, but +, Insert and Enter to log the qso.
The default is the TRlog sequence which uses "+" to switch between RUN and S&P modes,
and just ENTER to call and log the qso.

.TR
.B TLFCOLORx=
Defaults:
   TLFCOLOR1=23	(Header and footer)
   TLFCOLOR2=67	(Pop up windows)
   TLFCOLOR3=70	(Log window)
   TLFCOLOR4=57	(Markers/dupe colour)
   TLFCOLOR5=43	(Input fields)
   TLFCOLOR6=63	(Window frames)

The numbers in octal, fg/bg or bg/fg (you have to try it).
You should only specify these if you don't agree with the standard colours of tlf.
In some Terminals you can set a special profile for tlf with your own colours...
Another way is to define the colors is via the .Xdefault file.

.TR
.B EDITOR=<joe | vi | e3 | mc>
Editor used to edit the log or logcfg.dat

.TR
.B CALL=<PA0R>
Your call used in messages, and used to determine your country, zone and continent.

.TR
.B TIME_OFFSET=<0> (0...23)
Used to shift the tlf time with respect to the computer clock. Normally 0.

.TR
.B TIME_MASTER
This node transmits the time over the network (only one master allowed!)

.TR
.B ADDNODE=<node address>
Adds an ip address to which we broadcast stuff.
(WARNING: Only add addresses of other nodes).

.TR
.B THISNODE=<A...H>
Node designator (default 'A'). If tlf hears it's own node ID on the network it will exit and ask you to pick another one!!

.TR
.B LANDEBUG
Switches on the debug function. Dumps all tlf net traffic received on this node into a file named "debuglog" in the working directory. This log can be used as a backup log for the whole
network, as it is easy to retrieve qso data, cluster messages, gab messages etc. 
after the contest. I have it on all the time!!

.TR
.B NETKEYER
Switches the cw keyer on. Only the ip networked keyer cwdaemon is actively supported.
You may also need the keyer for PTT or Band info output.

.TR
.B NETKEYERPORT=<port number> (default = 6789)

.TR
.B NETKEYERHOST=<host address> (default = 127.0.0.1, localhost)

.TR
.B MFJ1278_KEYER=<serial port>
Switches supprt for the MFJ1278B multi-mode controller on.
The 1278 supports CW as well as RTTY contesting.
Fixed baud rate  9600 Baud.

.TR
.B CWSPEED=<speed in wpm> (4...69)

.TR
.B WEIGHT=<-45...50>
Only for NETKEYER.

.TR
.B TXDELAY=<PTT delay in ms> (0...50)

.TR
.B SOUNDCARD
Use soundcard for sidetone output

.TR
.B SIDETONE_VOLUME=<soundcard volume> (0...99)
Set soundcard sidetone volume (default=70). A value of 0 turns off sidetone
output (even for the console speaker).

.TR
.B CQDELAY=<Auto_cq delay in 1/2 seconds> (3...60)
Use a value which is message length + listening time!!

.TR
.B CWTONE=<pc speaker or soundcard sidetone> (0...999)
A value of 0 switches the sidetone off (!!! Due to a bug in cwdaemon 
it also turns off the 
.B Alt-t
tune function. Use
.B SIDETONE_VOLUME = 0
instead).

.TR
.B BANDOUTPUT
Outputs band information to pins 2, 7, 8, 9 on the parallel port.
Output is 1 (160m), 2 (80m) ... 9 (10m). This format is compatible with the standard
interface for antenna switches, band filters etc...

.TR
.B BANDOUTPUT=124181818
Output pin 2 for 160, 30, 17 and 12,  pin 7 for 80, pin 8 for 40, and
pin 9 for 20, 15 and 10. This comes in handy when you have 3 dipoles and
a 3-band beam (...).

.TR
.B NO_BANDSWITCH_ARROWKEYS
This will prevent unwanted band switching when you are not using
rig control. Band up=alt-b, band down = alt-v (Trlog compatible).

.TR
.B TELNETHOST=<cluster address>
e.g. claudia.esrac.ele.tue.nl or 131.155.192.179

.TR
.B TELNETPORT=<telnet port of cluster>
e.g. 8000

.TR
.B TNCPORT=<serial port>
You can use e.g. /dev/ttyS0, /dev/ttyUSB1, etc... anything that
looks like a tty.

.TR
.B TNCSPEED=<Baud rate>
Tlf supports 1200, 2400, 4800 and 9600 Baud

.TR
.B FIFO_INTERFACE
The fifo interface is used when you want to receive cluster info from the network,
of from another source. The fifo interface uses a fifo in the working directory called /fBclfile/fR.
Anything you dump into this fifo will be displayed by the packet interface.

.TR
.B RADIO_CONTROL
Switches the radio interface on. The rig interface makes use of the Hamlib library which
supports a lot of different rigs.

.TR
.B RIGMODEL=<rig number>
Look at the Hamlib stuff for the NUMBER of your rig.

.TR
.B RIGSPEED=<Baud rate>
Speed of the serial port.

.TR
.B RIGPORT=<serial port>
You can use e.g. /dev/ttyS0, /dev/ttyUSB1, etc... anything that
looks like a tty.
RPC rig daemon users should have RIGMODEL=1901 and RIGPORT=localhost.
In this case RIGSPEED is ignored.

.TR
.B RIGCONF=
Will send rig configuration parameters to Hamlib
E.g.: RIGCONF=civaddr=0x40,retry=3,rig_pathname=/dev/ttyS0

.TR
.B RIT_CLEAR
Clears the RIT after logging the qso. This only works if the rig, and the
hamlib routine supports it. (It works for the OMNI 6+).

.TR
.B CWBANDWIDTH=<width>
Sets the cw bandwidth of your rig when changing bands. If unset or 0 the
default bandwidth (as determined by hamlib) is used. (You have to use a
valid bandwidth for your rig!).

.TR
.B SC_DEVICE=
Sound card device for scan function (e.g. /dev/dsp0)

.TR
.B S_METER=
Audio s-meter calibration values for the scan function
e.g. S_METER=20,19,18,17,16,15,14,13,12,11,10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1

.TR
.B SSBMODE
Start tlf in ssb mode (default is CW)

.TR
.B RTTYMODE
Start tlf in RTTY mode (defaul is CW)

.TR
.B GMFSK=/home/youruser/gMFSK.log
Tell miniterm where to get the data

.TR
.B DIGIMODEM=/home/youruser/gmfsk_autofile
Tell tlf where to send the macros

.TR
.B CLUSTER
Show cluster window at startup.

.TR
.B CLUSTERLOGIN=yourcall
Automatic login for the telnet client.

.TR
.B CLUSTER_LOG
Write clusterlog to disk.

.TR
.B BANDMAP
Shows cluster bandmap on startup. Use '.' to change bandmap filtering.

.TR
.B BANDMAP=<xyz>,<number>
Show cluster bandmap on startup and set start values for filtering.
  <xyz> string parsed for
  'B' - only own band
  'M' - only own mode
  'D' - do not show dupes
  'S' - skip dupes during grab_next (ctrl-g)
  <number> livetime for new spots in second (number >=30)

.TR
.B SCOREWINDOW
Show the score window (same as Alt-R cmd)

.TR
.B CHECKWINDOW
Show the country/call check window

.TR
.B PARTIALS
Show a list of possible contest calls

.TR
.B USE_PARTIALS
Use the auto-complete utility (takes some practise...).
Tlf will complete the call as soon as it is unique in the database.
This can of course lead to strange effects, but in my experience there are far
more hits than misses. Sometimes you must edit the call because it has locked
on a unique call.... Try it, and switch it off when you don't like it.

.TR
.B LOGFREQUENCY
Put frequency (kHZ) into qso number to enable logging of frequency (only qso
and dxped mode)

.TR
.B IGNOREDUPES
Enable to make multiple qsos in a contest

.TR
.B SUNSPOTS=<SSN>
Set the sunspots value which is used to do a rough calculation of the MUF.
If the cluster interface is used the SSN will be updated by WWV or WCY messages.

.TR
.B SFI=<Solar flux value>
Set SFI used to calculate SSN. The SSN value is used to do a rough calculation of
the MUF. If the packet interface is used the SSN will be updated by WWV or WCY messages.

.TR
.B CHANGE_RST 
If set in logcfg.dat, Pg-up and Pg-down will change RST instead of CW speed if field is not empty. Default: off.

.TR
.B NOB4
Don't send automatic "qso b4" message (default: on)

.TR
.B NOAUTOCQ
No automatic cq when pressing enter or F12.

.TR
.B MARKERS=<file name>
Generate marker file for Xplanet. Xplanet will show the last 8 spots
on an azimuthal map. See the relevant xplanet documentation. Use azimuthal
projection, and center the map on your qth.

.SH "RULES"
.TR
The contest rules can be put into separate files. Tlf will first look for a
directory called "rules/" in the working directory, and a file "<contest_name>".
If tlf cannot find that it will look into the directory @prefix@/share/@PACKAGE@/rules.
A rules file contains contest specific content like multipliers, point, messages etc.
The rules file overrides the logcfg.dat file.
.B WARNING! It is your own reponsibility to try these rules well BEFORE the contest. The 
author of tlf cannot possible check all rules for all contests :) and during the contest the 
author is contesting (we are in it for the fun, remember...).

.B CONTEST=xxxxx
Name of the contest (same as the file name).
Some contests, like cqww and wpx, are pre-programmed. look for the relevant rules file in @prefix@/share/tlf/rules.

.TR

Mandatory

.TR 
.B CABRILLO=<cabrillo_format> 
Specify the name of the cabrillo format to use (see doc/README.cab).

.TR
.B CONTEST_MODE
Sets contest mode. Uncomment for normal qso logging.

.TR
.B NO_RST
Do not use RST in contest (e.g. for CW Open or ARRL Field Day). Use '---' as placeholder instead of RST in the logfile and the main display. If you want to write a cabrillo log you have to provide an according format definition without RST values.

.TR
.B CQWW_M2
Put the node ID into the logline (just after the qso number) to support Multi/2 operation where the station logging the qso must be in the cabrillo file. This can also be used for M/1 and M/M, to enable post-contest analysis of the nodes.

.TR
.B Macro characters in the messages

.SH "FILES"
.TR

\fB@prefix@/share/@PACKAGE@/logcfg.dat\fR
is a recent example of the configuration file tlf needs to know what to do. Tlf
won't start without one. \fBCopy it into the working directory\fP and edit it
before use. You should do your experiments well *before* the contest...
It contains e.g. your call, name of the log file, info about ports for cw, packet or rig control, contest rules,
points, multipliers etc. etc..

\fB@prefix@/share/@PACKAGE@/rules/contestname\fR
contains the rules of the various contests. You can easily write one
for your favourite contest making use of the various multiplier and points capabilities..
Check it before the contest and message to tlf-devel@nongnu.org if anything is wrong.

\fB@prefix@/share/@PACKAGE@/cty.dat\fR
contains a flat ascii data base of info about countries. Tlf-1.1.0 contains an
actual version from december 2011 (tnx Martin OK1RR). This is the same file 
as used by CT or TRlog.

\fB@prefix@/share/@PACKAGE@/mastercalls\fR
contains a flat ascii data base of contest callsigns (> 25.000), which is rather old.

\fBsection files\fR
contain a flat ascii data base of multpliers like states, sections, provinces, 
d.istricts, names, ages, etc... Some are available at the tlf project download 
site (\fBhttp://www.iae.nl/users/reinc/TLF-0.2.html)\fR. They are invoked by including
MULT_LIST=<sectionfilename> in the rules file.

.SH "DOCUMENTATION"
.TR
An operation manual (a little bit outdated) is available in html format at the tlf old project page (\fBhttp://sharon.esrac.ele.tue.nl/pub/linux/ham/tlf/)\fR.
