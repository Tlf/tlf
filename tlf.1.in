@PACKAGE_NAME@ - amateur radio contest keyer/logging program for
Radiosport
.SH SYNOPSIS

.SH DESCRIPTION
.
.B @PACKAGE_NAME@
is a console (ncurses) mode general purpose
.SM CW
keyer, logging and contest program for amateur radio operators. It supports the
.SM CQWW,
.SM WPX,
.SM ARRL-DX,
.SM ARRL-FD,
.SM STEWPERRY,
.SM PACC
and
.SM EU SPRINT
contests as well as a lot more basic contests, general QSO and DXpedition mode.
From version 1.2.0 onward there is also support for the FOC Marathon.  It
interfaces with a Morse Code generator, a number of radios via the
.B Hamlib
library, and with a
.B "DX Cluster"
via telnet or packet radio.  @PACKAGE_NAME@ can project DX cluster data into
the excellent Xplanet program, written by Hari Nair.
.P
Contest operation mimics the popular
.B TR-Log
program for DOS, the output file is TR-Log compatible.  The log can be exported
in
.SM ADIF
or
.B Cabrillo
format.
.P
The program was written for console mode on purpose, which allows it to run
on smaller machines, or remotely via
.SM SSH
or a modem link.
.P
Since @PACKAGE_NAME@ version 0.9.21 the
.B cwdaemon
0.9 is fully supported, featuring direct mode for the keyboard and output to
parallel and serial ports and speed and weight control from the keyboard, and
band info output on the parallel port.
.P
For radio control @PACKAGE_NAME@ works with Hamlib (version >= 1.2.3), you
can find it at
.UR https://sourceforge.net/projects/hamlib/
SourceForge.net
.UE .
.P
@PACKAGE_NAME@ provides full
.SM TCP/IP
networking between @PACKAGE_NAME@ nodes, syncing/distributing log, packet data,
frequency data, local talk, serial numbers, time sync etc.

.
.SH USAGE
.
@PACKAGE_NAME@ has been written for
.BR "console mode" \.
If you want to run @PACKAGE_NAME@ from a terminal in
.BR X ,
you will probably get the best results if you set
.BI TERM= linux
and use a Linux console terminal.  Both KDE and GNOME terminals have a facility
to start a Linux console in an X terminal as does Xfce.
.P
By default, Xterm may give unreadable colours.  If so, you will have to set
different colours in
.IR logcfg.dat \.
.P
Recent efforts have resulted in improved keyboard handling.  If you find keys
that do not work, the developers would like to receive your report of which
keys and which terminal have the problem.  Please send the report to the
mailing list shown in the
.B BUGS
 section below.
.P
There are excellent results with the latest KDE, GNOME, and Xfce consoles (vi
colours are preferred by some).  As @PACKAGE_NAME@ uses ncurses to format its
display you must use a proper font.  (The Linux font works o.k., Inconsolata
does as well).  If you have problems, try the linux text console first and work
from there.
.P
Normally you start or restart @PACKAGE_NAME@ in fast mode with
.BR @PACKAGE@ \.
During debugging of a
.I logcfg.dat
file you can start in verbose mode, to have a look at the startup messages.
From @PACKAGE_NAME@ version 0.9.3 you can load different config files with:
.
.IP
.EX
@PACKAGE@ \-f config_file
.EE
.
.P
If you have the packet cluster enabled you will first see the packet screen (if
you are using telnet and you have provided your callsign in
.IR logcfg.dat \,
you will be automatically logged in switched to the mail logging screen).  Log
in with your callsign, if needed, and switch to @PACKAGE_NAME@ with
.B :
\*(lqEnter\*(rq.  You can come back to the packet screen later with the same
command from the call input field.
.P
You can exit and close @PACKAGE_NAME@ with the
.B :EXIt
or
.B :QUIT
commands or with
.BR Ctrl-C ,
.BR Alt-Q \ or
.BR Alt-X \.
.P
At restart @PACKAGE_NAME@ recalculates the score, which may take some time
depending on the number of QSOs in the logfile and the speed of your
system.  @PACKAGE_NAME@ takes the points as they are in the log, and
calculates the multiplier from either callsign or exchange field (depending
on the contest).
.
.SH COMMANDS
.
These commands are entered in the
.B callsign
field of the main logging screen.  Each command consists of the leading
\(lq:\(rq and at minimum the upper case characters of the command name plus
any needed parameters separated by \*(lqSpace\*(rq.
.
.TP
.BR :ADI f
Writes the log to an Amateur Data Interchange Format (ADIF) file
.IR logfile.adif \.
.
.TP
.BR :CHA r
Input the number of characters for CW auto-start or \*(lqm\*(rq for manual
start. Possible values are: \*(lq0\*(rq (off), \*(lq2\*(rq...\*(lq5\*(rq or
\*(lqm\*(rq (manual).  After typing as many characters in the input field or
after pressing the \*(lqEnter\*(rq key in manual mode @PACKAGE_NAME@ starts
sending the callsign without further keystrokes.  You can type in the rest of
the call (but quickly).  As soon as the sending catches your last typed
character @PACKAGE_NAME@ automatically sends the exchange and the cursor jumps
to the exchange field.  \*(lqEscape\*(rq stops sending.  This works only in CW
contests in RUN mode.

.BR :SOU nd
The SOUND recorder is a utility to record the voice keyer messages and enables
you to record the complete contest in chunks of 1 hour to the hard drive.  It
does this in the directory:
.IR $HOME/@PACKAGE@/soundlogs \.
The sound recorder uses a script called
.B soundlog
which has to be located in
.IR $HOME/@PACKAGE@/soundlogs \.
It can be found in the
.B scripts
directory.  If your soundcard is different from
.I /dev/dsp
you can use the
.B SC_DEVICE
parameter in the
.I logcfg.dat
file.  The file extension is
.IR .au ,
the Sun ulaw format.  The recorder produces < 60 MB per hour.  This means you
can record a complete CQWW in less than 3 Giga Bytes. If your disk cannot
handle this, FTP the soundfile to a server every hour.

.
.SH KEYS
.
Work has been ongoing to unify the key map between the Linux text console and
the various X terminals.  It may be slightly different on certain X terminals
depending on which keys they consume for their own use.  Turn off any key
recognition by the terminal for its own purposes (menu access, help display,
etc.) if possible.  Pay special attention to the F1-F12 and Alt-<char> keys.
Moreover, on some systems you must set the
.BI TERM= linux
or
.BI TERM= rxvt
environment variables.  This also works under VNC.
.P
Certain key combinations will probably not be useable as the Linux console
consumes Alt-F1 through
.RI Alt-F x
(often F7, but could be greater) for switching its virtual consoles.
Likewise, the various desktop environments consume key combinations for their
own use.  Ctrl-F1 through
.RI Ctrl-F x
are used to switch desktop workspaces.
.RI Alt-F x
combinations are used for various desktop features and are unavailable
for @PACKAGE_NAME@ use.
.P
Some desktop terminal emulators are capable of being configured to allow the
application running in them to get all of the keys the desktop environment
does not consume.  In testing good choices seem to be Gnome Terminal, Rox
Terminal, or the classic Xterm (although its color representation differs from
the Linux console and other terminal emulators).  Xfce Terminal is known to
consume F11 and Ctrl-PageUp and Ctrl-PageDown.  The @PACKAGE_NAME@ developers
have implemented Alt-PageUp and Alt-PageDown as a work-around for the Ctrl
counterparts.  Reports of success with other terminals are welcome.
.
.SS Call Input and Exchange Fields
.
The Call Input and Exchange Fields are the two main entry fields of
@PACKAGE_NAME@ where the majority of the keyboard entry takes place.  The call
input field is active when @PACKAGE_NAME@ completes its initialization and
presents the main screen.
.P
Most key sequences are the same in both fields.  Differences are noted as
necessary.
.
.TP
.BR A-Z ,\  0-9 ,\  /
\fBCall input:\fR ASCII letters, numerals, and the '/' characters that make up
an internationally recognized amateur radio callsign plus temporary location
identifiers.  Spaces are not allowed.
.IP
\fBExchange:\fR information provided by the other station possibly separated by
spaces, e.g., ARRL Field Day and ARRL Sweepstakes.
.
.TP
.B Space
Switches from call input to exchange field.  Separates exchange field elements
when multiple exchange elements must be entered, e.g., ARRL Field Day and ARRL
Sweepstakes.
.
.TP
.B Tab
Switch between call input and exchange fields (jump back to call input from
exchange field).
.
.TP
.B Enter
Smart key depending on contest mode.
.
.IP
@PACKAGE_NAME@ follows the TR operating style which has two modes, CQ and S&P.
.IP
CQ mode is used for \*(lqrunning\*(rq, i.e., staying on one frequency and
having other stations answer your call.
.br
S&P mode is for tuning up or down the band and answering the calls of other
stations.
.
.IP
.B CQ Mode:
.RS 7
.IP \(bu 2
With the call input field empty sends the F12 message (Auto CQ).
.IP \(bu 2
With characters in the call input field, answers the calling station by sending
the F5 message (HIS) followed by the F3 message (RST) and moves the cursor to
the exchange field.
.IP \(bu 2
If the exchange field is empty, repeats the F5 and F3 messages.
.IP \(bu 2
After the exchange information received from the other station is entered,
sends the CQ_TU_MSG message, logs the QSO, and the cursor is returned to the
call input field to answer the next call.
.RE
.
.IP
.B S&P Mode:
.RS 7
.IP \(bu 2
With the call input field empty sends the F6 message (MY).
.IP \(bu 2
If the exchange field is empty sends the F6 message (MY).
.IP \(bu 2
With characters in the call input field sends the F6 message (MY) and moves the
cursor to the exchange field.
.IP \(bu 2
Once the exchange has been received, sends the F4 message (73) followed by the
F3 message (RST), logs the QSO, and the cursor is returned to the call input
field to answer the next call.
.RE
.
.TP
.B Backspace
Erases the character to the left of the cursor and moves the cursor one
position to the left.
.
.TP
.B Escape
Stop CW transmission, clears characters, returns to call input field, keyboard
off (universal undo).
.IP
As an example, characters have been entered in both the call input and
exchange fields, the cursor is in the exchange field, and the transmission of
a CW message is in progress.  The first press of \*(lqEscape\*(rq will stop
the CW transmission and clear the exchange field and position the cursor to
the leftmost position of the exchange field.  The second press of
\*(lqEscape\*(rq will move the cursor to the right of the last character in
the call input field.  The third press of \*(lqEscape\*(rq will clear the call
input field.
.
.TP
.BR \(<-\  (Left-Arrow)
Change to next band lower or wrap to highest band if already on the lowest band
when callsign field empty.
.IP
Enter edit mode if one or more characters are present and move the cursor to
the left of the rightmost character.
.
.TP
.BR \(->\  (Right-Arrow)
Change to next band higher or wrap to the lowest band if already on the highest
band when call input field is empty.
.
.IP
If both key combinations do not working try ':cqd' instead.
.
.TP
.B F1
In CQ mode, send message F1 (CQ).
.br
In S&P mode send message F6 (MY).
.
.TP
.B F2-F11
Send CW, RTTY or VOICE messages 2 through 11.
.
.TP
.B F12
Start
.B Auto_CQ
(only from call input field).  Sends F12 message repeatedly pausing for Auto_CQ
delay time between messages.  Auto_CQ is cancelled with first character entry
into the call input field.
.
.TP
.BR +\  (Plus)
Toggle between the CQ and S&P modes.
.
.TP
.B PgUp
Increase CW (Morse Code) speed (from call and exchange fields).
.IP
If the cursor is in the call input field and it is not empty and CHANGE_RST is
set: increase his S value (the leftmost of the RST pair).
.IP
If the cursor is in the exchange field and it is not empty and CHANGE_RST is
set: increase my S value (the rightmost of the RST pair).
.
.TP
.B PgDown
Decrease CW (Morse Code) speed (from call input and exchange fields).
.IP
If the cursor is in the call input field and it is not empty and CHANGE_RST is
set: decrease his S value (the leftmost of the RST pair).
.IP
If the cursor is in the exchange field and it is not empty and CHANGE_RST is
set: decrease my S value (the rightmost of the RST pair).
.
.TP
.B Ctrl-PgUp

.SH PREFERENCES
.
@PACKAGE_NAME@ can be fully configured by editing the
.I logcfg.dat
file.  Normally you keep one
.I logcfg.dat
file, setting up your callsign, the log file name, the ports and addresses for
packet, the radio, the network etc., and a separate rules file per contest.
.P
The
.I logcfg.dat
file can be edited from within @PACKAGE_NAME@ by the
.BR :CFG \ or \ :SET
commands (or with any other plain text editor before starting @PACKAGE_NAME@).
.P
You can set your favourite editor (joe | vi[m] | e3 | mcedit) in the
.IR logcfg.dat \ file.
.P
You connect the rules file by using the statement
.BI RULES= contest_rules_file_name
in
.IR logcfg.dat .
.P
@PACKAGE_NAME@ will first look in the working directory for a
.I logcfg.dat
file, and if it cannot find one it will look in
.I @prefix@/share/@PACKAGE@
for a default one.  Make sure you edit the
.I logcfg.dat
file at least to hold your call and your preferred system configuration.
.
.SH LOGCFG.DAT STATEMENTS
.
Configuration parameters set in
.I logcfg.dat
located in the working directory (where @PACKAGE_NAME@ is started).
.
.TP
.BI RULES= contest_rules_filename
Name of the rules file to load.  It helps if you name the rules file according
to the contest you want to describe.

.TP
.B USE_PARTIALS
Use the auto-complete utility (takes some practice...).  @PACKAGE_NAME@
will complete the call as soon as it is unique in the database.  This can
of course lead to strange effects, but in my experience there are far more
hits than misses.  Sometimes you must edit the call because it has locked
on a unique call.  Try it, and switch it off when you don't like it.

.BI POWERMULT= power_multiplier
Use this value to multiply the final points.  If the contest rule allows one
to use the power multiplier (e.g. Stewperry, ARRL-FD), you can pass that
here.
.IP
\fBNB\fR: The type of
.B POWERMULT
is a float, e.g. \fBPOWERMULT=\fI1.5\fR, but the final score will rounded

.TP
.B SEND_DE
Sends a \(lqDE\(rq word before your callsign, e.g. \(lqDE W1AW\(rq. There
is a special case: if
.B SEND_DE
is present in logcfg.dat, and @PACKAGE_NAME@ if is in DIGIMODE, then the
other station's callsign will be sent before \(lqDE\(rq, e.g. \(lqDL1A DE
W1AW\(rq.
.
.SH RULES
.
The contest rules can be put into separate files.  @PACKAGE_NAME@ will
first look for a directory called \(lqrules/\(rq in the working directory,
and a file named for the contest, \(lq<contest_name>\(rq.  If
@PACKAGE_NAME@ cannot find such a file, it will look into the directory
@prefix@/share/@PACKAGE@/rules.  A rules file contains contest specific
parameters like multipliers, scoring rules, CW and voice keyer messages,
etc.
.P
.B NB:
The rules file overrides settings from the logcfg.dat file!
.P
.B WARNING!
It is your own reponsibility to try these rules well BEFORE the contest.
The authors of @PACKAGE_NAME@ cannot possibly check all rules for all
contests :) and during the contest there is normally no time to fix it.

.TP
.B CQWW_M2
Put the node ID into the logline (just after the QSO number) to support
Multi/2 operation where the station logging the QSO must be in the Cabrillo

calculated based on the distance between the stations.
.
.TP
.B QTC
If you want to send or receive QTC's on contest (usually on WAEDC), put this
option to logcfg.dat. This needs a parameter, which could be one of these:

information, please see the README_QTC.txt file.
.
.TP
.B QTC_CAP_CALLS= list_of_qtc_capable_callsigns.txt
If you want to help yourself to indicate, the station is a QTC capable,
you can see it on your bandmap or worked window. Put the callsign of stations
to a file, one callsign per line, and put it to as argument to this variable.
.
.TP
.B QTC_AUTO_FILLTIME
If you use QTC feature, and you are on EU station in CW/SSB modes, then you can
only RECEIVE the QTC's. Most sender station send their QTC's as a most short form,
example, after the first line it doesn't send the first two characters of time
field. If you set this option, then when you fill the first QTC line, then Tlf
will fills the other time fields, only the first two characters. Of course, if you
change the hour (eg., if there is a time: 2059, and the next one is 2100), then
all next time fields will be changed.
.
.TP
.B QTC_RECV_LAZY
If you use QTC feature, and you are on EU station in CW/SSB modes, then you can use
this feature. In normal case, Tlf checks all received QTC lines: the time field
must be 4 characters long, callsign and serial fields must be non-empty. If you set up
this option, Tlf will ignore this restrictions.

.TP
.BI CONTINENTLIST= "comma separated list of continents"
Valid values are: SA, NA, EU, AF, AS and OC.

Allow a point weighting factor for different bands. E.g.
.br
BANDWEIGHT_POINTS=160:3,80:2,40:1,20:1,15:1,10:2
.br
can be used for AADX contest. It will multiply all QSO points by 3 on 160m,
by 2 on 80m and 10m and on all other bands only by 1.
.IP
Bands not in list are weighted by 1.
.
.TP
.B BANDWEIGHT_MULTIS
Allow a weigthing factor for multipliers on different bands. E.g.
.br
BANDWEIGHT_MULTIS=80:4,40:3,20:2,15:2,10:2
.br
can be used for WAEDC contest. It will multiply the number of multipliers on
80 by 4, on 40 by 3 and on 20/15/10 by 2.
.IP
The multiply operation is executed after any other multiplier modification.
.IP
Bands not in list will be weighted by 1.
.
.TP
.B PFX_NUM_MULTIS
On WAEDC (and maybe on another contest too) the multipliers are the different countries.
But there is an execption: in case of some country the different prefix number is
a different multiplier. On WAEDC these countries are: W, VE, VK, ZL, ZS, JA, PY and
RA8/RA9 and RAØ. Now with this option, you can list the affected countries:
PFX_NUM_MULTIS=W,VE,VK,ZL,ZS,JA,PY,UA9. Then Tlf will reads these items, makes a lookup
in a countrylist for a country code, and that code will be used. So, if you placed
UA9 prefix, then Tlf will looks the UA9, which is Asiatic Russia. If you made a QSO
with a station from Asiatic Russia, then the PFX number will evaulated with a new
multiplier - but Europien Russia will not.
.
.TP
.B EXCLUDE_MULTILIST
Some contest has a special multipliers list, which is easier to write with a substract
of two predefined set. For example, the main set could be COUNTRY_MULT, and you need
to substract from that just a few countries, than SAC test uses (then the scandinavian
stations aren't multiplier for each other). In that case you can use this config:
.BI
  COUNTRY_MULT
  COUNTRYLIST=sac:JW,JX,LA,OF1,OF0,OJ1,OJ0,OX,OW,OZ,SM,TF
  EXCLUDE_MULTILIST=COUNTRYLIST
.
Another useful example at WAEDC RTTY contest: then all stations can work with each others,
for EU stations only the non-EU stations are the multi's, and reverse: for non-EU stations
only the EU stations are the multipliers. In that case the EU stations can use this config:
.BI
  CONTINENTLIST=EU
  COUNTRY_MULT
  EXCLUDE_MULTILIST=CONTINENTLIST
.
Now all country are multi, except the EU stations. In this contest the non-EU stations
can use this config:
.BI
  CONTINENTLIST=SA,NA,AF,AS,OC
  COUNTRY_MULT
  EXCLUDE_MULTILIST=CONTINENTLIST
.
In this example all countries are multis, except from SA, NA, AF, OC and AS continent, so
only the EU stations left as multipliers.

.TP
.B BMAUTOGRAB
If set, with \fBRADIO_CONTROL\fR and \fBBANDMAP\fR (mandatory) options, Tlf will grab the callsign from
bandmap, if the TRX frequency is equal with bandmap freq.
.
.TP
.B BMAUTOADD
If set, with \fBRADIO_CONTROL\fR and \fBBANDMAP\fR (mandatory) options, Tlf will add the callsign from
callsign field, if its length is 3 character at least. Use 'S'kip dupes in
BANDMAP settings to control if it should also grab dupes.

\fB@prefix@/share/@PACKAGE@/logcfg.dat\fR is a recent example of the
configuration file @PACKAGE_NAME@ needs to know what to do.  @PACKAGE_NAME@
won't start without one.  \fBCopy it into the working directory\fR and edit
it before use.  You should do your experiments well \fIbefore\fR the
contest.  It contains, amongst other settings, your call, name of the log
file, info about ports for CW keying, packet or rig control, contest rules,
points, multipliers etc.
