@PACKAGE_NAME@ - amateur radio contest keyer/logging program for
Radiosport
.SH SYNOPSIS

.YS
.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.
.B @PACKAGE_NAME@
is a console (ncurses) mode general purpose
.SM CW
keyer, logging and contest program for amateur radio operators. It supports
the
.SM CQWW,
.SM WPX,
.SM ARRL-DX,
.SM ARRL-FD,
.SM STEWPERRY,
.SM PACC
and
.SM EU SPRINT
contests as well as a lot more basic contests, general QSO and DXpedition
mode.  From version 1.2.0 onward there is also support for the FOC Marathon.
It interfaces with a Morse Code generator, a number of radios via the
.B Hamlib
library, and with a
.B "DX Cluster"
via telnet or packet radio.  @PACKAGE_NAME@ can project DX cluster data into
the excellent Xplanet program, written by Hari Nair.
.P
Contest operation mimics the popular
.B TR-Log
program for DOS, the output file is TR-Log compatible.  The log can be
exported in
.SM ADIF
or
.B Cabrillo
format.
.P
The program was written for console mode on purpose, which allows it to run on
smaller machines, or remotely via
.SM SSH
or a modem link.
.P
Since @PACKAGE_NAME@ version 0.9.21 the
.B cwdaemon
0.9 is fully supported, featuring direct mode for the keyboard and output to
parallel and serial ports and speed and weight control from the keyboard, and
band info output on the parallel port.
.P
For users of the K1EL series of \(lqWin Keyers\(rq, the
.B winkeydaemon
is available from
.UR https://github.com/N0NB/winkeydaemon
GitHub
.UE .
Setup is the same as for the cwdaemon.
.P
For radio control @PACKAGE_NAME@ works with Hamlib (version >= 1.2.8), you
can find it at
.UR https://www.hamlib.org/
www.hamlib.org
.UE .
.P
@PACKAGE_NAME@ provides full
.SM TCP/IP
networking between @PACKAGE_NAME@ nodes, syncing/distributing log, packet
data, frequency data, local talk, serial numbers, time sync etc.
.P
.
.SH OPTIONS
Options given to @PACKAGE_NAME@ on the command line.
.TP
.B \-h
Show summary of options and exit.
.TP
.BI \-f\  config_file
Start with non-default configuration file:
.

.EE
.IP
Defaults to
.I logcfg.dat
in actual working directory.
.TP
.BI \-s\  user:password@host/dir/logfilename

.B \-V
Output version information and exit.
.TP
.B \-v
Verbose startup.
.TP
.B \-d
Debug
.B rigctl.
.TP
.B \-n
Start without packet/cluster.
.TP
.B \-r
Start without radio control when user wants to start @PACKAGE_NAME@ without
modifying
.IR logcfg.dat \.
.TP
.B \-i
Import an existing CABRILLO file. When @PACKAGE_NAME@ starts, looks for the
.I YOURCALL.cab
log, reads the configuration and rule files, and based on the
current setup, generates the log(s). If the contest is WAE, and you have QTC's
in cabrillo, then @PACKAGE_NAME@ makes the QTC logfiles too. @PACKAGE_NAME@
doesn't write over the existing log(s).  The generated import will be
.IR IMPORT_CONTEST.log ,
where the CONTEST is the name of contest in the config. If
QTC exists, then the files
.I IMPORT_QTC_sent.log
and
.I IMPORT_QTC_recv.log
will be created.
.
.SH USAGE
.
@PACKAGE_NAME@ has been written for
.BR "console mode" \.
If you want to run @PACKAGE_NAME@ from a terminal in
.BR X ,
you will probably get the best results if you set \fBTERM\fR=\fIlinux\fR and
use a Linux console terminal.  Both KDE and GNOME terminals have a facility to
start a Linux console in an X terminal as does Xfce-terminal.
.P
By default,
.BR xterm (1)
may give unreadable colours.  If so, you will have to set
different colours in
.I logcfg.dat
or prepare
.I $HOME/.Xresources
to the preferred colour scheme.  One advantage of xterm is that it doesn't
consume the
.B F11
key which other terminal emulators reserve for full screen mode nor
.BR Ctrl\-PgUp / Ctrl\-PgDn
which may be used for tab switching in other emulators.
.P
Recent efforts have resulted in improved keyboard handling.  If you find keys
that do not work, the developers would like to receive your report of which
keys and which terminal have the problem.  Please send the report to the
mailing list shown in the
.B BUGS
section below.
.P
There are excellent results with the latest KDE, GNOME, and Xfce terminal
emulators (vi colours are preferred by some).  As @PACKAGE_NAME@ uses ncurses
to format its display you must use a proper font.  (Good choices are the Linux
font, Inconsolata, Hack, or any monospace font that dots or slashes the zero
character).  If you have problems, try the linux text console first and work
from there.
.P
Normally you start or restart @PACKAGE_NAME@ in fast mode with
\(lq\fB@PACKAGE@\fR\(rq.  During debugging of a
.I logcfg.dat
file you can start in verbose mode, to have a look at the startup messages.
From @PACKAGE_NAME@ version 0.9.3 you can load different config files with:
.
.IP
.EX
@PACKAGE@ \-f config_file
.EE
.
.P
If you have the packet cluster enabled you will first see the packet screen
(if you are using telnet and you have provided your callsign in
.IR logcfg.dat \,
you will be automatically logged in switched to the main logging screen).  Log
in with your callsign, if needed, and switch to the main logging screen with
the \(oq:\(cq command.  You can come back to the packet screen later with the
.BR :PAC ket
command from the call input field of the main logging screen.
.P
You can exit and close @PACKAGE_NAME@ with the
.BR :EXI t
or
.BR :QUI t
commands or with
.BR Ctrl\-C ,
.BR Alt\-Q \ or
.BR Alt\-X \.
.P
At restart @PACKAGE_NAME@ recalculates the score, which may take some time
depending on the number of QSOs in the logfile and the speed of your system.
@PACKAGE_NAME@ takes the points as they are in the log, and calculates the
multiplier from either callsign or exchange field (depending on the contest).
.
.SH COMMANDS
.
These commands are entered in the
.B callsign
field of the main logging screen.  Each command consists of the leading
\(oq:\(cq and at minimum the upper case characters of the command name plus
any needed parameters separated by \(oqSpace\(cq.
.
.TP
.BR :ADI f
Writes the log to an Amateur Data Interchange Format (ADIF) file
.IR logfile.adif \.
.
.TP
.BR :CHA r
Input the number of characters for CW auto-start or \(oqm\(cq for manual
start. Possible values are: \(oq0\(cq (off), \(oq2\(cq...\(oq5\(cq or
\(oqm\(cq (manual).  After typing as many characters in the input field or
after pressing the \(oqEnter\(cq key in manual mode @PACKAGE_NAME@ starts
sending the callsign without further keystrokes.  You can type in the rest of
the call (but quickly).  As soon as the sending catches your last typed
character @PACKAGE_NAME@ automatically sends the exchange and the cursor jumps
to the exchange field.  \(oqEscape\(cq stops sending.  This works only in CW
contests in RUN mode.

.BR :SOU nd
The SOUND recorder is a utility to record the voice keyer messages and enables
you to record the complete contest in chunks of 1 hour to the hard drive.  It
does this in the directory:
.IR $HOME/@PACKAGE@/soundlogs .
The sound recorder uses a script called
.I soundlog
which has to be located in
.IR $HOME/@PACKAGE@/soundlogs .
It can be found in the
.I scripts
directory.  If your soundcard is different from
.I /dev/dsp
you can use the
.B SC_DEVICE
parameter in the
.I logcfg.dat
file.  The file extension is
.IR .au ,
the Sun ulaw format.  The recorder produces < 60 MB per hour.  This means you
can record a complete CQWW in less than 3 Giga Bytes. If your disk cannot
handle this, FTP the soundfile to a server every hour.
.IP
.BR "F1 ... F12" ,\  s ,\  c ,\ ...

.RS
.RS
.P
xx is the offset from the start of the file e.g.:
.P
2110 will start from beginning of the day 21 hr 10:00 file.
.P
21100013:00 will start from day 21, hh 10, mm 00, + 13 minutes: 0 seconds.

.
.SH KEYS
.
Work has been ongoing to unify the key map between the Linux text console and
the various X terminals.  It may be slightly different on certain X terminals
depending on which keys they consume for their own use.  Turn off any key
recognition by the terminal for its own purposes (menu access, help display,
etc.) if possible.  Pay special attention to the F1-F12 and Alt-<char> keys.
Moreover, on some systems you must set the \fBTERM\fR=\fIlinux\fR or
\fBTERM\fR=\fIrxvt\fR environment variables.  This also works under VNC.
.P
Certain key combinations will probably not be useable as the Linux console
consumes Alt-F1 through
.RI Alt-F x
(often F7, but could be greater) for switching its virtual consoles.
Likewise, the various desktop environments consume key combinations for their
own use.  Ctrl-F1 through
.RI Ctrl-F x
are used to switch desktop workspaces.
.RI Alt-F x
combinations are used for various desktop features and are unavailable
for @PACKAGE_NAME@ use.
.P
Some desktop terminal emulators are capable of being configured to allow the
application running in them to get all of the keys the desktop environment
does not consume.  In testing good choices seem to be Gnome Terminal, Rox
Terminal, or the classic Xterm (although its color representation differs from
the Linux console and other terminal emulators).  Xfce Terminal is known to
consume F11 and Ctrl-PageUp and Ctrl-PageDown.  The @PACKAGE_NAME@ developers
have implemented Alt-PageUp and Alt-PageDown as a work-around for the Ctrl
counterparts.  Reports of success with other terminals are welcome.
.
.SS Call Input and Exchange Fields
.
The Call Input and Exchange Fields are the two main entry fields of
@PACKAGE_NAME@ where the majority of the keyboard entry takes place.  The call
input field is active when @PACKAGE_NAME@ completes its initialization and
presents the main screen.
.P
Most key sequences are the same in both fields.  Differences are noted as
necessary.
.
.TP
.BR A-Z ,\  0-9 ,\  /
\fBCall input:\fR ASCII letters, numerals, and the '/' characters that make up
an internationally recognized amateur radio callsign plus temporary location
identifiers.  Spaces are not allowed.
.IP
\fBExchange:\fR information provided by the other station possibly separated by
spaces, e.g., ARRL Field Day and ARRL Sweepstakes.
.
.TP
.B Space
Switches from call input to exchange field.  Separates exchange field elements
when multiple exchange elements must be entered, e.g., ARRL Field Day and ARRL
Sweepstakes.
.
.TP
.B Tab
Switch between call input and exchange fields (jump back to call input from
exchange field).
.
.TP
.B Enter
Smart key depending on contest mode.
.
.IP
@PACKAGE_NAME@ follows the TR operating style which has two modes, CQ and S&P.
.IP
CQ mode is used for \(lqrunning\(rq, i.e., staying on one frequency and
having other stations answer your call.
.br
S&P mode is for tuning up or down the band and answering the calls of other
stations.
.
.IP
.B In CQ Mode:
.RS 7
.IP \(bu 2
With the call input field empty,
\(oqEnter\(cq
sends the F12 message (Auto CQ).
.IP \(bu 2
With characters in the call input field,
\(oqEnter\(cq
answers the calling station by sending
the F3 message (RST) and moves the cursor to
the exchange field.
.IP \(bu 2
If the exchange field is empty,
\(oqEnter\(cq
repeats the F3 message (RST).
.IP \(bu 2
After the exchange information received from the other station is entered,
\(oqEnter\(cq
sends the CQ_TU_MSG message if defined,
or \(lqTU\(rq and your call otherwise.
Afterwards it logs the QSO,
and returns the cursor to the
call input field to answer the next call.
.RE
.
.IP
.B In S&P Mode:
.RS 7
.IP \(bu 2
When the call input field is empty,
\(oqEnter\(cq
sends the S&P_CALL_MSG if defined,
or your call otherwise.
.IP \(bu 2
When the exchange field is empty,
\(oqEnter\(cq
sends the S&P_CALL_MSG if defined,
or your call otherwise.
.IP \(bu 2
When the call input field has been filled,
\(oqEnter\(cq
sends the S&P_CALL_MSG if defined,
or your call otherwise.
Afterwards it moves the cursor to the exchange field.
.IP \(bu 2
Once the exchange has been received,
\(oqEnter\(cq
sends the S&P_TU_MSG if defined,
otherwise it sends your call
followed by the F3 message (RST).
Afterwards it logs the QSO
and returns the cursor to the call input
field to answer the next call.
.RE
.
.TP
.B Backspace
Erases the character to the left of the cursor and moves the cursor one
position to the left.
.
.TP
.B Escape
Stop CW transmission, clears characters, returns to call input field, keyboard
off (universal undo).
.IP
As an example, characters have been entered in both the call input and
exchange fields, the cursor is in the exchange field, and the transmission of
a CW message is in progress.  The first press of \(oqEscape\(cq will stop
the CW transmission and clear the exchange field and position the cursor to
the leftmost position of the exchange field.  The second press of
\(oqEscape\(cq will move the cursor to the right of the last character in
the call input field.  The third press of \(oqEscape\(cq will clear the call
input field.
.
.TP
.BR \(<-\  (Left-Arrow)
Change to next band lower or wrap to highest band if already on the lowest band
when callsign field empty.
.IP
Enter edit mode if one or more characters are present and move the cursor to
the left of the rightmost character.
.
.TP
.BR \(->\  (Right-Arrow)
Change to next band higher or wrap to the lowest band if already on the highest
band when call input field is empty.
.
.TP
.B F1
In CQ mode, send message F1 (CQ).
.br
In S&P mode send message F6 (MY).
.
.TP
.B F2-F11
Send CW, RTTY or VOICE messages 2 through 11.
.
.TP
.B F12
Start
.B Auto_CQ

delay time between messages.  Auto_CQ is cancelled with first character entry
into the call input field.
.
.TP
.BR +\  (Plus)
Toggle between the CQ and S&P modes.
.
.TP
.B PgUp
Increase CW (Morse Code) speed (from call and exchange fields).
.IP
If the cursor is in the call input field and it is not empty and CHANGE_RST is
set: increase his S value (the leftmost of the RST pair).
.IP
If the cursor is in the exchange field and it is not empty and CHANGE_RST is
set: increase my S value (the rightmost of the RST pair).
.
.TP
.B PgDown
Decrease CW (Morse Code) speed (from call input and exchange fields).
.IP
If the cursor is in the call input field and it is not empty and CHANGE_RST is
set: decrease his S value (the leftmost of the RST pair).
.IP
If the cursor is in the exchange field and it is not empty and CHANGE_RST is
set: decrease my S value (the rightmost of the RST pair).
.
.TP
.B Ctrl-PgUp
.TQ

@PACKAGE_NAME@ can be fully configured by editing the
.I logcfg.dat
file.  Normally you keep one
.I logcfg.dat
file, setting up your callsign, the log file name, the ports and addresses for
packet, the radio, the network etc., and a separate rules file per contest.
.P
The
.I logcfg.dat
file can be edited from within @PACKAGE_NAME@ by the
.BR :CFG \ or \ :SET
commands (or with any other plain text editor before starting @PACKAGE_NAME@).
.P
You can set your favourite editor (joe | vi[m] | e3 | mcedit) in the
.IR logcfg.dat \ file.
.P
You connect the rules file by using the statement
\fBRULES\fR=\fIcontest_rules_file_name\fR in
.IR logcfg.dat .
.P
@PACKAGE_NAME@ will first look in the working directory for a
.I logcfg.dat
file, and if it cannot find one it will look in
.I @prefix@/share/@PACKAGE@
for a default one.  Make sure you edit the
.I logcfg.dat
file at least to hold your call and your preferred system configuration.

.B CTCOMPATIBLE
Do not use the TR-Log QSO sequence, but use \(oq+\(cq, \(oqInsert\(cq and
\(oqEnter\(cq to log the QSO.
.
.IP
The default mode of operation is the TR-Log sequence which uses \(oq+\(cq to
switch between CQ and S&P modes, in which \(oqEnter\(cq is the sole key used
to call the other station, send the exchange, and log the QSO.

.IP
(Due to a bug in cwdaemon it also turns off the
.B Alt-T
tune function.  Use \fBSIDETONE_VOLUME\fR=\fI0\fR instead).
.
.TP
.B BANDOUTPUT
Outputs band information to pins 2, 7, 8, 9 on the parallel port.  Output is 1
(160m), 2 (80m) ... 9 (10m).  This format is compatible with the standard

\fBTNCSPEED\fR=\fIserial_rate\fR
@PACKAGE_NAME@ supports 1200, 2400, 4800 and 9600 bps.
.
.TP
.B FIFO_INTERFACE
The FIFO (First In First Out) interface is used when you want to receive
cluster info from the network, or from another source.  The FIFO interface
uses a special FIFO file in the working directory called
.BR clfile .
Anything you dump into this FIFO will be displayed by the packet interface.
.
.TP

available use it to activate the radio's PTT for sending voice messages instead
of the NetKeyer PTT.
.
.TP
\fBCWBANDWIDTH\fR=\fIwidth\fR
Sets the CW bandwidth of your rig when changing bands.  If unset or 0 the

.B CHECKWINDOW
Show the country/call check window.
.
.TP
.B PARTIALS
Show a list of possible contest calls.
.
.TP
.B USE_PARTIALS
Use the auto-complete utility (takes some practice...).  @PACKAGE_NAME@ will
complete the call as soon as it is unique in the database.  This can of course
lead to strange effects, but in practice there are far more hits than misses.
Sometimes you must edit the call because it has locked on a unique call.  Try
it, and switch it off when you don't like it.
.
.TP
.B LOGFREQUENCY
Put frequency (kHz) into QSO number to enable logging of frequency (only QSO
and dxped mode).
.
.TP
.B IGNOREDUPES
Enable to allow multiple QSOs in a contest with the same station (considered a
good idea these days as contest bots will take care of dupes).
.
.TP
\fBSUNSPOTS\fR=\fISSN\fR
Set the sunspots value which is used to do a rough calculation of the MUF.  If
the cluster interface is used the SSN will be updated by WWV or WCY messages.
.
.TP
\fBSFI\fR=\fISolar_flux_value\fR
Set SFI used to calculate SSN.  The SSN value is used to do a rough
calculation of the MUF.  If the packet interface is used the SSN will be
updated by WWV or WCY messages.

\fBMARKERS\fR=\fIfile_name\fR
Generate marker file for Xplanet.  Xplanet will show the last 8 spots on an
azimuthal map.  See the relevant Xplanet documentation.  Use azimuthal
projection and center the map on your QTH.
.
.TP
\fBPOWERMULT\fR=\fIpower_multiplier\fR
Use this value to multiply the final points.  If the contest rule allows one
to use the power multiplier (e.g. Stewperry, ARRL-FD), you can pass that here.
.IP
\fBNB\fR: The type of
.B POWERMULT
is a float, e.g. \fBPOWERMULT\fR=\fI1.5\fR, but the final score will be
rounded by the C library \fBfloor\fR(3) function, which gives the largest
integer value that is not greater than multiplied score.
.
.TP
.B SEND_DE
Sends a \(lqDE\(rq word before your callsign, e.g. \(lqDE W1AW\(rq. There
is a special case: if
.B SEND_DE
is present in logcfg.dat, and @PACKAGE_NAME@ if is in DIGIMODE, then the
other station's callsign will be sent before \(lqDE\(rq, e.g. \(lqDL1A DE
W1AW\(rq.
.
.TP
\fBDIGI_RIG_MODE\fR=\fImode\fR
If set with \fBRADIO_CONTROL\fR option, specifies the mode to change the
rig to when :DIG mode is selected. \fImode\fR may be one of \(lqUSB\(rq, \(lqLSB\(rq,
\(lqRTTY\(rq, or \(lqRTTYR\(rq.  If not set, \(lqUSB\(rq is used if FLDIGI is
set and \(lqLSB\(rq is used otherwise.
.
.SH RULES
.
The contest rules can be put into separate files.  @PACKAGE_NAME@ will
first look for a directory called
.I rules/
in the working directory,
and a file named for the contest, e.g.
.IR cqww .
If @PACKAGE_NAME@ cannot find such a file, it will look into the directory
.IR @prefix@/share/@PACKAGE@/rules .
A rules file contains contest specific parameters like multipliers, scoring
rules, CW and voice keyer messages, etc.
.P
.BR NB :
The rules file overrides settings from the
.I logcfg.dat
file!
.P
.B WARNING!
It is your own reponsibility to try these rules well BEFORE the contest.
The authors of @PACKAGE_NAME@ cannot possibly check all rules for all
contests :) and during the contest there is normally no time to fix it.

normal QSO logging!
.
.TP
.B NO_RST
Do not use RST in contest, e.g. for CW Open, ARRL Sweepstakes, or ARRL Field
Day.  If you want to write a Cabrillo log you must provide a conforming format
definition without RST values.
.
.TP
.B CQWW_M2
Put the node ID into the logline (just after the QSO number) to support
Multi/2 operation where the station logging the QSO must be in the Cabrillo

JN97, or the full form: JN97OM.  In Stewperry, the points are calculated based
on the distance between the stations.
.
.TP
.B QTC
If you want to send or receive QTC's on contest (usually on WAEDC), put this
option to logcfg.dat. This needs a parameter, which could be one of these:
RECV, SEND, BOTH - note, that currently just the RECV works. For more
information, please see the README_QTC.txt file.
.
.TP
\fBQTC_CAP_CALLS\fR=\fIlist_of_qtc_capable_callsigns.txt\fR
If you want to help yourself to indicate that the station is QTC capable, you
can see it on your bandmap or worked window. Put the callsign of stations in a
file, one callsign per line, and give it as an argument to this variable.
.
.TP
.B QTC_AUTO_FILLTIME
If you use QTC feature, and you are on EU station in CW/SSB modes, then you
can only RECEIVE the QTC's. Most sender station send their QTC's as a most
short form, example, after the first line it doesn't send the first two
characters of time field. If you set this option, then when you fill the first
QTC line, then @PACKAGE_NAME@ will fills the other time fields, only the first
two characters. Of course, if you change the hour (eg., if there is a time:
2059, and the next one is 2100), then all next time fields will be changed.
.
.TP
.B QTC_RECV_LAZY
If you use QTC feature, and you are on EU station in CW/SSB modes, then you
can use this feature. In normal case, @PACKAGE_NAME@ checks all received QTC
lines: the time field must be 4 characters long, callsign and serial fields
must be non-empty. If you set up this option, @PACKAGE_NAME@ will ignore this
restrictions.
.
.TP
\fBCONTINENTLIST\fR=\fI"comma separated list of continents"\fR
Valid values are: SA, NA, EU, AF, AS and OC.
.
.TP
\fBCONTINENT_LIST_POINTS\fR=\fId\fR
Points for stations from continents in CONTINENTLIST
.
.TP
.B USE_CONTINENTLIST_ONLY
Score zero points for station from continents not in the list.
.
.TP
.B BANDWEIGHT_POINTS
Allow a point weighting factor for different bands. E.g.
.br
\fBBANDWEIGHT_POINTS\fR=\fI160:3,80:2,40:1,20:1,15:1,10:2\fR
.br
can be used for AADX contest. It will multiply all QSO points by 3 on 160m, by
2 on 80m and 10m and on all other bands only by 1.
.IP
Bands not in list are weighted by 1.
.
.TP
.B BANDWEIGHT_MULTIS
Allow a weigthing factor for multipliers on different bands. E.g.
.br
\fBBANDWEIGHT_MULTIS\fR=\fI80:4,40:3,20:2,15:2,10:2\fR
.br
can be used for WAEDC contest. It will multiply the number of multipliers on
80 by 4, on 40 by 3 and on 20/15/10 by 2.
.IP
The multiply operation is executed after any other multiplier modification.
.IP
Bands not in list will be weighted by 1.
.
.TP
.B PFX_NUM_MULTIS
On WAEDC (and maybe with other contests too) the multipliers are the different
countries, but there are some exceptions where of certain countries a
different prefix number is a different multiplier. On WAEDC these countries
are: W, VE, VK, ZL, ZS, JA, PY and RA8/RA9 and RAØ.  With this option, you can
list the affected countries:
\fBPFX_NUM_MULTIS\fR=\fIW,VE,VK,ZL,ZS,JA,PY,UA9\fR.  @PACKAGE_NAME@ will read
these items, make a lookup in a countrylist for a country code, and that code
will be used.  If you include the UA9 prefix and then make a QSO with a
station from Asiatic Russia, the PFX number will evaulated with a new
multiplier, but European Russia will not.
.
.TP
.B EXCLUDE_MULTILIST
Some contests have a special multipliers list, which is easier to write with
by excluding a predefined set. For example, the main set could be
.BR COUNTRY_MULT ,
and you need to exclude from that list just a few countries, e.g. the SAC
contest excludes the Scandinavian contries as they are not multipliers). In
that case you can use this configuration:
.br
    \fBCOUNTRY_MULT\fR
    \fBCOUNTRYLIST\fR=\fIsac:JW,JX,LA,OF1,OF0,OJ1,OJ0,OX,OW,OZ,SM,TF\fR
    \fBEXCLUDE_MULTILIST\fR=\fICOUNTRYLIST\fR
.br
Another useful example at WAEDC RTTY contest: then all stations can work each
other, for EU stations only the non-EU stations are the multi's, and reverse:
for non-EU stations only the EU stations are the multipliers. In that case the
EU stations can use this config:
.br
    \fBCONTINENTLIST\fR=\fIEU\fR
    \fBCOUNTRY_MULT\fR
    \fBEXCLUDE_MULTILIST\fR=\fICONTINENTLIST\fR
.br
Now all country are multi, except the EU stations. In this contest the non-EU
stations can use this config:
.br
    \fBCONTINENTLIST\fR=\fISA,NA,AF,AS,OC\fR
    \fBCOUNTRY_MULT\fR
    \fBEXCLUDE_MULTILIST\fR=\fICONTINENTLIST\fR
.br
In this example all countries are multis, except from SA, NA, AF, OC and AS
continent, so only the EU stations left as multipliers.
.
.TP
.B BMAUTOGRAB
If set, with \fBRADIO_CONTROL\fR and \fBBANDMAP\fR (mandatory) options,
@PACKAGE_NAME@ will grab the callsign from bandmap, if the TRX frequency is
equal with bandmap freq.
.
.TP
.B BMAUTOADD
If set, with \fBRADIO_CONTROL\fR and \fBBANDMAP\fR (mandatory) options,
@PACKAGE_NAME@ will add the callsign from callsign field, if at least 3
character have been entered. Use \(lqS\(rqkip dupes in BANDMAP settings to
control if it should also grab dupes.
.
.TP
.B SPRINTMODE
If set, @PACKAGE_NAME@ will automatically switch its mode between LOG and S&P
after every QSO.
.
.TP
.B FLDIGI
If you work RTTY (or any other digital modes), you can communicate with Fldigi
through XMLRPC. The FLDIGI keyword will activate the interface.  By default it
connects to
.UR http://localhost:7362/RPC2
http://localhost:7362/RPC2
.UE .

If you run Fldigi's xmlrpc server on an different port use
\fBFLDIGI\fR=\fIhttp://localhost:port_#/RPC2\fR
.
.TP
\fBMINITEST \fR[=\fINNN\fR]
Use this option when the contest is a minitest like contest. In that contests
the full contest intervall is divided into shorter sections (e.g. 6 * 10
minute sections in an hour).  Any station can be worked once in each of the
time sections without counting as dupe.  The default length of the sections is
600 seconds (10 minutes), but you can pass another value (in seconds) after
the '=' sign. There must be an integral number of time sections per hour!
.
.TP
.B UNIQUE_CALL_MULTI
Multiplier is callsign.
You have to pass one of these arguments: ALL, BAND.

Example:

    \fBUNIQUE_CALL_MULTI\fR=\fIBAND\fR

The argument tells @PACKAGE_NAME@, how to score the callsigns as multipliers:
.br
.B ALL
means the callsign is a multiplier, independet of band.
.br
.B BAND
means the callsign counts as multiplier on different bands.
.
