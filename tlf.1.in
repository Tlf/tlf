.SH DESCRIPTION
.
.B @PACKAGE_NAME@
is a console (ncurses) mode general purpose CW keyer, logging and contest
program for amateur radio operators. It supports the CQWW, the WPX, the
ARRL-DX, the ARRL-FD, the STEWPERRY, the PACC and the EU SPRINT contests
as well as a lot more basic contests, general QSO and DXpedition mode.
From version 1.2.0 onward there is also support for the FOC Marathon.  It
interfaces with a morse code generator, a number of radios via the Hamlib
library, and with a DX Cluster.  @PACKAGE_NAME@ can project DX cluster data
into the excellent Xplanet program, written by Hari Nair.
.P
Contest operation mimics the popular TR-Log program for DOS, the output
file is TR-Log compatible.  The log can be exported in ADIF or Cabrillo
format.
.P
The program was written for console mode on purpose, which allows it to run
on smaller machines, or remotely via SSH or a modem link.
.P
Since @PACKAGE_NAME@ version 0.9.21 the cwdaemon 0.9 is fully supported,
featuring direct mode for the keyboard and output to parallel and serial
ports and speed and weight control from the keyboard, and band info output
on the parallel port.
.P
For radio control @PACKAGE_NAME@ works with Hamlib (version >= 1.2.3), you
can find it at
.UR https://sourceforge.net/projects/hamlib/
SourceForge.net
.UE .
.P
@PACKAGE_NAME@ provides full TCP/IP networking between @PACKAGE_NAME@
nodes, syncing/distributing log, packet data, frequency data, local talk,
serial numbers, time sync etc.

.
.SH USAGE
.
@PACKAGE_NAME@ has been written for \fBconsole mode\fR. If you want to run
@PACKAGE_NAME@ from a terminal in X, you will probably get the best results
if you set \fITERM=linux\fR and use a Linux console terminal.  Both KDE and
GNOME terminals have a facility to start a Linux console in an X terminal
as does Xfce.
.P
By default, Xterm will give unreadable colours.  You will have to set
different colours in the logcfg.dat file.  Also F1 does not work in Xterm,
which is not compatible with Linux consoles.  Other keys (sometimes F4 and
F5) may not work in your Xterm, YMMV.
.P
There are excellent results with the latest KDE, GNOME, and Xfce consoles
(I prefer vi colours).  As @PACKAGE_NAME@ uses ncurses to format its
display you must use a proper font.  (The Linux font works o.k.,
Inconsolata does as well).  If you have problems, try the linux text
console first and work from there.
.P
Normally you start or restart @PACKAGE_NAME@ in fast mode with
\fB@PACKAGE@\fR.  During debugging of a logcfg.dat file you can start in
verbose mode, to have a look at the startup messages.  From @PACKAGE_NAME@
version 0.9.3 you can load different config files with:
.
.IP
.EX
@PACKAGE@ \-f config_file
.EE
.
.P
If you have the packet cluster enabled you will first see the packet
screen.  Log in with your callsign and switch to @PACKAGE_NAME@ with
\fB:\fR<Enter>.  You can come back to the packet screen later with the same
command from the call input field.
.P
You can exit and close @PACKAGE_NAME@ with the \fB:EXIt\fR or \fB:QUIT\fR
commands or with \fBCtrl-C\fR, \fBAlt-Q\fR or \fBAlt-X\fR.
.P
At restart @PACKAGE_NAME@ recalculates the score, which may take some time
depending on the number of QSOs in the logfile and the speed of your
system.  @PACKAGE_NAME@ takes the points as they are in the log, and
calculates the multiplier from either callsign or exchange field (depending
on the contest).
.
.SH COMMANDS
.
These commands are entered in the
.B callsign
field of the main logging screen.  Each command consists of the leading
\(lq\fB:\fR\(rq and at minimum the upper case characters of the command name plus
any needed parameters separated by <Space>.
.
.TP
.B :ADIf
Writes the log to an Amateur Data Interchange Format (ADIF) file (*.adif).
.
.TP
.B :CHAr
Input the number of characters for CW auto-start or 'm' for manual start.
Possible values are: '0' (off), '2'...'5' or 'm' (manual).  
After typing as many characters in the input field or after pressing 
the enter key in manual mode @PACKAGE_NAME@ starts sending 
the callsign without further
keystrokes.  You can type in the rest of the call (but quickly).  As soon
as the sending catches your last typed character @PACKAGE_NAME@
automatically sends the exchange and the cursor jumps to the exchange
field.  <Esc> stops sending.  This works only in CW contests in RUN mode.

.
.TP
.B :SOUnd
The SOUND recorder is a utility to record the voice keyer messages and
enables you to record the complete contest in chunks of 1 hour to the hard
drive.  It does this in the directory: ~/@PACKAGE@/soundlogs.  The sound
recorder uses a script called
.B soundlog
which has to be located in ~/@PACKAGE@/soundlogs.  It can be found in the
.B scripts
directory.  If your soundcard is different from /dev/dsp you can use the
.B SC_DEVICE
parameter in the logcfg.dat file (my soundcard is at SC_DEVICE=/dev/dsp1).
The file extension is .au, the Sun ulaw format.  The recorder produces < 60
MB per hour.  This means you can record a complete CQWW in less than 3 GB.
If your disk cannot handle this, FTP the soundfile to a server every hour.
.IP
.BR "F1 ... F12" ,\  s ,\  c ,\ ...
will record the voice keyer message for that key.
.IP
.BR 1 :
Start contest recording to ddhhmm.au.
.IP
.BR 2 :
Stop contest recording.
.IP
.BR 3 :
Play back contest recording ddhh[mm][:xx].
.RS
.RS
.P
xx is the offset from the start of the file e.g.:
.P
2110 will start from beginning of the day 21 hr 10:00 file.
.P
21100013:00 will start from day 21, hh 10, mm 00, + 13 minutes: 0 seconds.
.RE

every hour:
.RS
.RS
.P
.EX
/usr/bin/pkill \-f sox > /dev/null 2> /dev/null
.EE
.P
Running the cron job at other intervals will create sound recordings of the
interval period in length.
.RE
.RE
.IP
Once started the recorder will run until the lock file
.B ~/.VRlock
is removed.
.
.TP
.B :SYNc
Synchronize the logfile of this node with the logfile pointed to by
parameter SYNCFILE=<user:password@host/dir/logfile>.  @PACKAGE_NAME@ will

.
The keymap refers to the Linux text console.  It may be slightly different
on X terminals.  Turn off any key recognition by the terminal for its own
purposes (menu access, help display, etc.).  Pay special attention to the
F1-F12 and Alt-<char> keys.  Moreover on some systems you must set
\fB\TERM=linux\fR\ or \fB\TERM=rxvt\fR.  This also works under VNC.

.SH PREFERENCES
.
@PACKAGE_NAME@ can be fully configured by editing the
.I logcfg.dat
file.  Normally you keep one logcfg.dat file, setting up your callsign, the
log file name, the ports and addresses for packet, the radio, the network
etc., and a separate rules file per contest.
.P
The logcfg.dat file can be edited from within @PACKAGE_NAME@ by the
\fB:CFG\fR or \fB:SET\fR commands (or with any other plain text editor
before startign @PACKAGE_NAME@).
.P
You can set your favourite editor (joe | vi[m] | e3 | mcedit) in the
logcfg.dat file.
.P
You connect the rules file by using the statement
.BI RULES= contest_rules_file_name
in logcfg.dat.
.P
@PACKAGE_NAME@ will first look in the working directory for a logcfg.dat
file, and if it cannot find one it will look in @prefix@/share/@PACKAGE@
for a default one.  Make sure you edit the logcfg.dat file at least to hold
your call and your preferred system configuration.
.
.SH LOGCFG.DAT STATEMENTS
.
Configuration parameters set in \(lqlogcfg.dat\(rq located in the working
directory (where @PACKAGE_NAM@ is started).
.TP
.BI RULES= contest_rules_filename
Name of the rules file to load.  It helps if you name the rules file
according to the contest you want to describe.
.
.TP
.BI SYNCFILE= user:password@host/dir/syncfile
File on remote host you want to synchronize with (use \fBwget\fR(1)
syntax).
.
.TP
.B CTCOMPATIBLE
Does not use the TR-Log QSO sequence, but \(lq+\(rq, <Insert> and <Enter>
to log the QSO.
.
.IP
The default is the TR-Log sequence which uses \(lq+\(rq to switch between
Run and Search & Pounce modes, in which <Enter> is the sole key used to
call the other station, send the exchange, and log the QSO.
.
.TP
.BI TLFCOLOR x = FG/BG
Defaults:
        \fBTLFCOLOR1=\fI23\fR   (Header and footer)
        \fBTLFCOLOR2=\fI67\fR   (Pop up windows)
        \fBTLFCOLOR3=\fI70\fR   (Log window)
        \fBTLFCOLOR4=\fI57\fR   (Markers/dupe colour)
        \fBTLFCOLOR5=\fI43\fR   (Input fields)
        \fBTLFCOLOR6=\fI63\fR   (Window frames)
.
.IP
The numbers are given in octal, FG/BG or BG/FG (some experimentation likely
required).
.
.IP
You should only specify these if you do not agree with the standard colours
of @PACKAGE_NAME@.  In some Terminals you can set a special profile for
@PACKAGE_NAME@ with your own colours.  Another way is to define the colours
is via an ~/.Xdefault file.
.
.TP
\fBEDITOR=\fIjoe\fR | \fIvi\fR[\fIm\fR] | \fIe3\fR | \fImcedit\fR
Editor used to modify the QSO log or logcfg.dat.
.
.TP
.BI CALL= PA0R
Your call used in messages and used to determine your country, zone and
continent.
.
.TP
.BI TIME_OFFSET= 0
Used to shift the @PACKAGE_NAME@ time with respect to the computer clock.
Normally 0.  Range: 0-23.
.
.TP
.B TIME_MASTER
This node transmits the time over the network (only one master allowed!).

Adds an IP address (and optionally a port number) to which we broadcast
stuff.  (WARNING: Only add addresses of other nodes).
.
.TP
.BI THISNODE= A
Node designator (default \(aqA\(aq).  If @PACKAGE_NAME@ hears its own node
ID on the network it will exit and ask you to pick another one!  Range:
A-H.
.
.TP
.B LANDEBUG
Switches on the debug function.  Dumps all @PACKAGE_NAME@ net traffic
received on this node into a file named \(lqdebuglog\(rq in the working
directory.  This log can be used as a backup log for the whole network, as
it is easy to retrieve QSO data, cluster messages, gab messages etc. after
the contest.  Some users have this enabled all the time.
.
.TP
.B NETKEYER
Switches the CW keyer on.  Only the IP networked keyer cwdaemon is actively
supported.  You may also need the keyer for PTT control or band info
output.
.
.TP

.
.TP
.B SOUNDCARD
Use soundcard for sidetone output.
.
.TP
.BI SIDETONE_VOLUME= soundcard_volume
Set soundcard sidetone volume (default is 70).  A value of 0 turns off
sidetone output (even for the console speaker).  Range: 0-99.
.
.TP
.BI CQDELAY= Auto_cq
Set automatic CQ delay in 1/2 seconds increments.  Range: 3-60.  Use a
value which is message length + listening time!
.
.TP
.BI CWTONE= sidetone
Set the PC speaker or soundcard frequency.  A value of 0 switches the
sidetone off.  Range: 0-999.
.
.IP
(Due to a bug in cwdaemon it also turns off the
.B Alt-T
tune function.  Use
.BI SIDETONE_VOLUME= 0
instead).
.
.TP
.B BANDOUTPUT
Outputs band information to pins 2, 7, 8, 9 on the parallel port.  Output
is 1 (160m), 2 (80m) ... 9 (10m).  This format is compatible with the
standard interface for antenna switches, band filters etc.
.
.TP
.BI BANDOUTPUT= 124181818
Output pin 2 for 160, 30, 17 and 12, pin 7 for 80, pin 8 for 40, and pin 9
for 20, 15 and 10.  This comes in handy when you have 3 dipoles and a
3-band beam (...).
.
.TP
.B NO_BANDSWITCH_ARROWKEYS
This will prevent unwanted band switching when you are not using rig
control.  Band up =
.BR Alt-B ,
band down =
.B Alt-V
(TR-Log compatible).
.
.TP
.BI TELNETHOST= cluster_address
Use Telnet to connect to a DX Cluster node using a DNS name or IP address,
e.g. claudia.esrac.ele.tue.nl or 131.155.192.179.
.
.TP
.BI TELNETPORT= telnet_port_of_cluster
DX Clusters often use a non-standard port for Telnet, e.g. 8000.
.
.TP
.BI TNCPORT= serial_port
You can use /dev/ttyS0, /dev/ttyUSB1, etc. anything that looks like a tty.
.
.TP
.BI TNCSPEED= serial_rate
@PACKAGE_NAME@ supports 1200, 2400, 4800 and 9600 bps.
.
.TP
.B FIFO_INTERFACE
The FIFO (First In First Out) interface is used when you want to receive
cluster info from the network, or from another source.  The FIFO interface
uses a special FIFO file in the working directory called
.BR clfile .
Anything you dump into this FIFO will be displayed by the packet interface.
.
.TP
.B RADIO_CONTROL
Switches the radio interface on.  The rig interface makes use of the Hamlib
library which supports a number of different rigs.
.
.TP
.BI RIGMODEL= rig_number
Look at the Hamlib documentation for the rig_number.
.IP
Hint: \fBrigctl \-l\fR and its manual page (\fBrigctl\fR(1)).
.
.TP
.BI RIGSPEED= serial_rate
Speed of the serial port for rig control.
.
.TP
.BI RIGPORT= serial_port
You can use /dev/ttyS0, /dev/ttyUSB1, etc. anything that
looks like a tty.
.IP
RPC rig daemon users should use \fBRIGMODEL=\fI1901\fR and
\fBRIGPORT=\fIlocalhost\fR.  In this case RIGSPEED is ignored (rig model
1901 is deprecated in Hamlib > 3.0 and replaced by \fBrigctld\fR(8) which
is rig model 2).
.
.TP
.BI RIGCONF= rig_configuration_parameters
Send rig configuration parameters to Hamlib.

.B RIT_CLEAR
Clears the RIT after logging the qso.  This only works if the rig, and the
Hamlib routine supports it (tested on the OMNI 6+).
.
.TP
.BI CWBANDWIDTH= width
Sets the CW bandwidth of your rig when changing bands.  If unset or 0 the
default bandwidth (as determined by Hamlib) is used. (a valid bandwidth for
the rig must be used).

Show the score window (same as \fBAlt-R\fR).
.
.TP
.B CHECKWINDOW
Show the country/call check window.
.
.TP
.B PARTIALS
Show a list of possible contest calls.
.
.TP
.B USE_PARTIALS
Use the auto-complete utility (takes some practice...).  @PACKAGE_NAME@
will complete the call as soon as it is unique in the database.  This can
of course lead to strange effects, but in my experience there are far more
hits than misses.  Sometimes you must edit the call because it has locked
on a unique call.  Try it, and switch it off when you don't like it.
.
.TP
.B LOGFREQUENCY
Put frequency (kHz) into QSO number to enable logging of frequency (only QSO
and dxped mode).
.
.TP
.B IGNOREDUPES
Enable to allow multiple QSOs in a contest with the same station (considered
a good idea these days as contest bots will take care of dupes).
.
.TP
.BI SUNSPOTS= SSN
Set the sunspots value which is used to do a rough calculation of the MUF.
If the cluster interface is used the SSN will be updated by WWV or WCY messages.
.
.TP
.BI SFI= Solar_flux_value
Set SFI used to calculate SSN.  The SSN value is used to do a rough
calculation of the MUF.  If the packet interface is used the SSN will be
updated by WWV or WCY messages.

Default is On.
.
.TP
.B NOAUTOCQ
No automatic CQ when pressing <Enter> or F12.
.
.TP
.BI MARKERS= file_name
Generate marker file for Xplanet.  Xplanet will show the last 8 spots on an
azimuthal map.  See the relevant Xplanet documentation.  Use azimuthal
projection and center the map on your QTH.
.
.TP
.BI POWERMULT= power_multiplier
Use this value to multiply the final points.  If the contest rule allows to
use the power multiplier (e.g. Stewperry, ARRL-FD), you can pass that
here.
.IP
\fBNB\fR: The type of
.B POWERMULT
is a float, e.g. \fBPOWERMULT=\fI1.5\fR, but the final score will rounded
by the C library \fBfloor\fR(3) function, which gives the largest integer
value that is not greater than multiplied score.
.
.TP
.B SEND_DE
Sends a \(lqDE\(rq word before your callsign, e.g. \(lqDE W1AW\(rq. There
is a special case: if
.B SEND_DE
is present in logcfg.dat, and @PACKAGE_NAME@ if is in DIGIMODE, then the
other station's callsign will be sent before \(lqDE\(rq, e.g. \(lqDL1A DE
W1AW\(rq.
.
.SH RULES
.
The contest rules can be put into separate files.  @PACKAGE_NAME@ will
first look for a directory called \(lqrules/\(rq in the working directory,
and a file named for the contest, \(lq<contest_name>\(rq.  If
@PACKAGE_NAME@ cannot find such a file, it will look into the directory
@prefix@/share/@PACKAGE@/rules.  A rules file contains contest specific
parameters like multipliers, scoring rules, CW and voice keyer messages,
etc.
.P
.B NB:
The rules file overrides settings from the logcfg.dat file!
.P
.B WARNING!
It is your own reponsibility to try these rules well BEFORE the contest.
The authors of @PACKAGE_NAME@ cannot possibly check all rules for all
contests :) and during the contest there is normally no time to fix it.
.
.TP
.BI CONTEST= xxxxx
Name of the contest (same as the file name \(lq<contest_name>\(rq
referenced above).  Some contests, like CQWW and WPX, are pre-programmed.
Look for the relevant rules file in @prefix@/share/tlf/rules.
.
.TP
.BI LOGFILE= log_file_name
Mandatory!
.
.TP
.BI CABRILLO= cabrillo_format
Specify the name of the cabrillo format to use (see doc/README.cab).
.
.TP
.B CONTEST_MODE
Sets @PACKAGE_NAME@ into contest mode.  Do not use this parameter for
normal QSO logging!
.
.TP
.B NO_RST
Do not use RST in contest (e.g. for CW Open or ARRL Field Day).
Use \(aq---\(aq as placeholder instead of RST in the logfile and the main
display.  If you want to write a Cabrillo log you must provide a conforming
format definition without RST values.
.
.TP
.B CQWW_M2
Put the node ID into the logline (just after the QSO number) to support
Multi/2 operation where the station logging the QSO must be in the Cabrillo
file.  This can also be used for M/1 and M/M, to enable post-contest
analysis of the nodes.

.
.TP
.B PFX_MULT_MULTIBAND
Same as WPX, but the WPX only used CQ-WW-WPX, and there a single prefix multiplier only

usable on AA-DX.
.
.TP
.B COUNTRY_MULT
Multiplier is the DXCC entity (per band).
.
.TP

Name of multipliers file (often sections, provinces, states, counties).
May contain comment lines starting with \(aq#\(aq in the first column.
.
.TP
.B SECTION_MULT
Multiplier is section from multipliers file.
.
.TP
.B SERIAL+SECTION
Exchange is serial number and section, multipler is section from multiplier
file.  Mults count per band.
.
.TP
.B SERIAL_OR_SECTION
Exchange is serial number or section.  This option is similar to
SERIAL+SECTION, except the exchange could be a serial OR the section.  The
options was introduced for HA-DX, where HA stations gives the shortest form
of its county, other stations gives serial.
.
.TP
.B SERIAL+GRID4

exchange is the name of the operator:
.br
PA0R,rein
.br
PG4I,joop
.br
OK1RR,martin
.IP
If RECALL_MULTS is set, @PACKAGE_NAME@ will look in this list for the
exchange and fill it in for you.  There are various contests which have a
standard exchange, like e.g. the FOC Marathon.  The module also recognises
embedded calls (CT3/PA0R/QRP).
.
.TP
.B CONTINENT_EXCHANGE
Exchange is continent (NA, SA, EU, AS, AF, OC).

.
.TP
.B SSBMODE

.
.TP
.B MYQRA
For the \(lqStewperry\(rq contest, this option is used to set the QRA,
e.g.: JN97, or the full form: JN97OM.  In Stewperry, the points are
calculated based on the distance between the stations.
.
.TP
.B QTC
If you want to send or receive QTC's on contest (usually on WAEDC), put this
option to logcfg.dat. This needs a parameter, which could be one of these:
RECV, SEND, BOTH - note, that currently just the RECV works. For more
information, please see the README_QTC.txt file.
.
.TP
.B QTC_CAP_CALLS= list_of_qtc_capable_callsigns.txt
If you want to help yourself to indicate, the station is a QTC capable,
you can see it on your bandmap or worked window. Put the callsign of stations
to a file, one callsign per line, and put it to as argument to this variable.
.
.TP
.B QTC_AUTO_FILLTIME
If you use QTC feature, and you are on EU station in CW/SSB modes, then you can
only RECEIVE the QTC's. Most sender station send their QTC's as a most short form,
example, after the first line it doesn't send the first two characters of time
field. If you set this option, then when you fill the first QTC line, then Tlf
will fills the other time fields, only the first two characters. Of course, if you
change the hour (eg., if there is a time: 2059, and the next one is 2100), then
all next time fields will be changed.
.
.TP
.BI CONTINENTLIST= "comma separated list of continents"
Valid values are: SA, NA, EU, AF, AS and OC.
.
.TP
.BI CONTINENT_LIST_POINTS= d
Points for stations from continents in CONTINENTLIST
.
.TP
.B USE_CONTINENTLIST_ONLY
Score zero points for station from continents not in the list.
.
.TP
.B BANDWEIGHT_POINTS
Allow a point weighting factor for different bands. E.g.
.br
BANDWEIGHT_POINTS=160:3,80:2,40:1,20:1,15:1,10:2
.br
can be used for AADX contest. It will multiply all QSO points by 3 on 160m,
by 2 on 80m and 10m and on all other bands only by 1.
.IP
Bands not in list are weighted by 1.
.
.TP
.B BANDWEIGHT_MULTIS
Allow a weigthing factor for multipliers on different bands. E.g.
.br
BANDWEIGHT_MULTIS=80:4,40:3,20:2,15:2,10:2
.br
can be used for WAEDC contest. It will multiply the number of multipliers on
80 by 4, on 40 by 3 and on 20/15/10 by 2.
.IP
The multiply operation is executed after any other multiplier modification.
.IP
Bands not in list will be weighted by 1.
.
.TP
.B PFX_NUM_MULTIS
On WAEDC (and maybe on another contest too) the multipliers are the different countries.
But there is an execption: in case of some country the different prefix number is
a different multiplier. On WAEDC these countries are: W, VE, VK, ZL, ZS, JA, PY and
RA8/RA9 and RAØ. Now with this option, you can list the affected countries:
PFX_NUM_MULTIS=W,VE,VK,ZL,ZS,JA,PY,UA9. Then Tlf will reads these items, makes a lookup
in a countrylist for a country code, and that code will be used. So, if you placed
UA9 prefix, then Tlf will looks the UA9, which is Asiatic Russia. If you made a QSO
with a station from Asiatic Russia, then the PFX number will evaulated with a new
multiplier - but Europien Russia will not.
.
.TP
.B EXCLUDE_MULTILIST
Some contest has a special multipliers list, which is easier to write with a substract
of two predefined set. For example, the main set could be COUNTRY_MULT, and you need
to substract from that just a few countries, than SAC test uses (then the scandinavian
stations aren't multiplier for each other). In that case you can use this config:
.BI
  COUNTRY_MULT
  COUNTRYLIST=sac:JW,JX,LA,OF1,OF0,OJ1,OJ0,OX,OW,OZ,SM,TF
  EXCLUDE_MULTILIST=COUNTRYLIST
.
Another useful example at WAEDC RTTY contest: then all stations can work with each others,
for EU stations only the non-EU stations are the multi's, and reverse: for non-EU stations
only the EU stations are the multipliers. In that case the EU stations can use this config:
.BI
  CONTINENTLIST=EU
  COUNTRY_MULT
  EXCLUDE_MULTILIST=CONTINENTLIST
.
Now all country are multi, except the EU stations. In this contest the non-EU stations
can use this config:
.BI
  CONTINENTLIST=SA,NA,AF,AS,OC
  COUNTRY_MULT
  EXCLUDE_MULTILIST=CONTINENTLIST
.
In this example all countries are multis, except from SA, NA, AF, OC and AS continent, so
only the EU stations left as multipliers.
.
.TP
.B BMAUTOGRAB
If set, with \fBRADIO_CONTROL\fR and \fBBANDMAP\fR (mandatory) options, Tlf will grab the callsign from
bandmap, if the TRX frequency is equal with bandmap freq. This feature works only in S&P mode.
.
.TP
.B BMAUTOADD
If set, with \fBRADIO_CONTROL\fR and \fBBANDMAP\fR (mandatory) options, Tlf will add the callsign from
callsign field, if its lenght is 3 character at least. This feature works only in S&P mode.
.
