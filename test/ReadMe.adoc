Test setup
==========
Zoltan Csahok

General setup
-------------

The setup is as follows

*   There are test groups defined in *test_XX.c* files.
*   Each file defines test functions *void test_AA(void **state)*
*   Each test can have setup/teardown functions (*setup_AA()* and
    *teardown_AA()*) or there can be common (*_default*) s/t functions.
**      These functions are used by *cmocka_unit_test_setup_teardown*
*    A test group can have overall s/t functions, they are used in
    *cmocka_run_group_tests*
*    A test group specifies which objects it has to be linked with using 
    *// OBJECT bbb.o* syntax
*    For each test group an own runner *run_XX[.c]* is generated and built.
     It is linked with *data.c* (global data) and *functions.c* 
     (common net/hamlib functions).
*    Wrapping can be added later if needed.
*    *make check* runs the test groups and reports their result (_PASS_/_FAIL)_.
    The actual logs are in *run_XX.log* files, they contain detailed info on failures 
    (they are output by the CI jobs).
*   If new test groups or test cases are added then an *autoreconf -i* must be
  executed.
