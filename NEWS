tlf-1.1.1
=========
Minor maintenance release.

New features:
    - New doc/README.ssb gives some good hints how to use TLF on SSB contest.
      Thansk Andy, D4KNO for contributing.

Bug fixes:
    - Fix spelling of unmute command in scripts/play_vk. Tnx G4KNO
    - Make sure that no packet related functions get called if started 
      with 'tlf -n'
    - Fix segfault during build of logline if not in contest mode - esp.
      'RULES=qso'
    - Fix display of background for partials when leaving call edit mode

tlf-1.1.0
=========

Major release. Besides a lot of fixed bugs it provides some new features and 
internal improvements.
Thanks to all of you for pointing out bugs, submitting ideas and testing.
To name some without any order of ranks: Ben NJ8J, Martin OK1RR, Fred DM3MF,i
Andy G4KNO, Rob N6ROB and Graham VE3GTC. 

New features:
    - move tlf sources to public github repository (http://github.com/TLF/tlf)

    - implement a new bandmap function (see doc/New_Bandmap.txt for details)
      * move score display in upper right corner of display to make room for 
        the bandmap
      * Ctrl-A adds an observed station as spot to the bandmap and 
        broadcasts it to other stations in the LAN
      * Drop old SPOTLIST display (superseded by new bandmap)

    - changes in logcfg.dat handling !Fix your contest rules!
      * allow >9 points for any point scoring 
      * drop old unneeded keywords (MANY_CALLS, SPOTLIST, FILTER)
      * fixed keywords for CQ_TU_MSG, VKCQM and VKSPM according to manual
      * BANDMAP=<xxx>,<nn> allows configuration of the new bandmap display 
        (see man page)

    - Send VKCQM and VKSPM voice messages after end of QSO in SSB. 
    - Use external user adaptable script 'play_vk' for playing of 
      SSB voice key messages

    - add list of 'usa_canada' states and general 'contest' rules file 
      to installation files

    - drop special handling for TenTec ORION (correctly handled by hamlib in 
      meantime)

    - changed handling of comments for WYSIWYG_ONCE and WYSIWYG_MULTI
      Old code stopped multi recognition at first space in comment string. 
      Changed to use whole string but strip trailing spaces. Was so back 
      before tlf-0.9.21

    - Better handling of lines from external multiplier file
      * Allow comment lines (starting with '#')
      * strip leading and trailing whitespace
      * drop empty lines
         
    - New actual cty.dat file (December 2011). Thanks Martin OK1RR.

Fixed bugs:
    - segfaults due to a racing condition if heavy load on cluster
    - '+' and 'INSERT' keys in call and exchange input field respects
      CTCOMPATIBLE mode now
    - Allow edit of old QSO's only if call field is empty
    - Fix display of section in ARRL_SS and recognition of 'U' precedent
    - Fix upper boundaries for 160 and 40 meters.
    - Correct rescoring for WYSIWYG_* methods
    - keywords in logcfg.dat needs to start at column 0
    - correction of spelling errors and drop of old infos from man page
    - a lot of fixes of old problems:
      * proper locking to prevent racing conditions 
      * fix bad scoring of multis
      * correct position of pfx display in bottom line of check window
      * correct display of 1A stations in info line
      * wrong return value from searchcallarray
      * wrong handling of corner cases for some internal array scans

Reworked internal structure:
    - did some modernisation of configure.ac
    - start to use ncurses panel functions for overlapping windows and
      glib-2 for effective handling of large data collections
    - switch cty data handling and mults_possible to growing arrays and
      therefore allowing unlimited number of entries
    - simplify and drop unneeded code

tlf-1.0.5
=========
maintenance release
    * fixes some nasty racing condition between bandmap code and 
      checkwindow. In result prefix in lower line of checkwindow
      got displayed wrong, but country was right.
      Thansk Martin OK1RR for reporting.

tlf-1.0.4
=========
maintenance release
 * fix for wrong handling of recalled exchange (tnx OK1RR).
   New policy is a s follows
      - All calls from initial exchange file will be recognised even
	if part of a complex call, e.g. DL1CCL in LA/DL1CCL/p 
      - All calls from former QSO's have to be exact including any
	pre- or postcombination
      - Now complete exchange will be recalled (not only first word)

tlf-1.0.3
=========
maintenance release
 * fix buffer overflow in 'send_lan_message'
 * fix wrong count of points and qso's for last band entry (tnx OK1RR)

tlf-1.0.2
=========
maintenance release
 * fix bug in sendto call in TLF-1.0.0 and 1.0.1. 
   cwdaemon needs a zero terminated string. 

tlf-1.0.1
=========
maintenance release
 * fix logfile read error. Last QSO got read twice.
 * fix bug in cty.dat and in the routine which reads in the file
   Some prefixes from BY were not recognised.
 * fix calculation of sun up and down time in MUF prediction window.
   It is now based on longitude from country description in cty.dat 
   instead of the former timezone difference. That should be more
   accurate now.

tlf-1.0.0
=========

Major cleanup release. Fixes lot of buffer overruns in string handling, which 
stopped old version from working with new GCC and GLIBC.
 * Better recognition of hamlib install (tnx F8FCE) 
 * Rewrote handling of initial exchange file. It now allows empty 
   and comment lines (#) and spaces around the callsign. Leading 
   space before comment gets ignored.
 * Changed ESC handling in comment and call input field:
   Does no longer wipe out call and exchange field if you started sending.
 * New callmaster and cty.dat file (tnx OK1RR).

Bugfixes:
 * Fix input handling of notes.
 * Fix autocq handling. 
   - First characters gets no longer swallowed.
   - CQDELAY from logcfg.dat is now handled correct.
 * fix calculation of sunrise and sunset times 
 * fix calculation of QSO Rate
 * fix parsing for MARKERDOTS and MARKERCALL keywords in logcfg.dat
 * make Backspace and Delete-Keys the same to allow some more terminal 
   input encodings

tfl-0.9.31-2
============

'Possible calls' are now in top left corner, and share the space with 
the keyer. The 'possible calls' routine first checks the own log 
and then the callmasterdatabase.
Calls can now be up to 12 characters

tlf-0.9.31
==========

Fix for buffer overflow. 'Worked' window now searches from start of callsign.

tlf-0.9.30
==========
Bug fixes:
- exchange needed at least 1 character in dxped mode

RTTY miniterm changed to display line feeds (reading formatted texst is easier)
RTTY now sends linefeeds before and after the macro.

tlf-0.9.29
==========
Bug fixes:
- Date display error
- Spurious character error
- Malloc free error in socket.c
I also included Fabian's patch to searchlog.c for testing...I like it.

tlf-0.9.28
==========
Bug fixes (country indication did not work, wrong mults file for arrldx_dx).
Added interface to gMFSK to enable RTTY contesting.
Added new parameters for the logcfg.dat file:
	GMFSK (use gMFSK as an output device)
	RTTYMODE (start tlf in RTTY mode)
	DIGIMODEM=/home/youruser/gmfsk_autofile

You need the special version of gMFSK which is used for pskmail (http://pskmail.wikispaces.com).
Information on how to install this hacked version of gMFSK-0.6 is on the pskmail wiki.
Tlf takes care of all contest related stuff, exactly as you are used to in CW mode... 
Yyou can use keyboard mode (Alt-K in CW mode) by switching to the gMFSK send field 
with "Alt-TAB". This toggles between tlf and gMFSK.
This will be necessary until I have time to redo the gMFSK interface (a socket interface is 
on the todo list).

tlf-0.9.27
==========
Bug fixes (segfault at startup at some systems)

tlf-0.9.26
==========
Bug fix (segfault using the voice keyer).

tlf-0.9.25
==========

Bug fix for non-hamlib compilation

tlf-0.9.24
==========

- Code adaptation to compile with gcc-4.0 without warnings and segfaults (will compile on UBUNTU-5.10, FC4 etc..).

tlf-0.9.23
==========

- New function: start cw before call is complete. In contest mode, you can 
  start sending the call from the call window with 'space' or with 'down-arrow'.
- New command: :CHAR asks for number of characters the call must have 
  before sending starts. Default: 0 = OFF. If CHARS is 3, tlf starts sending 
  as soon as you have input the first 3 letters of the call. If you are on 
  slow speed you then have time to complete the call (including backspacing) 
  before sending the first 3 letters is finished. This is of limited use when 
  running above 40 wpm :)
- incorporated patch from W9WI fixing a bug in the voice keyer.
- changed cw speed control: now default active in call and exchange fields, 
  even if field is not empty
- changed qso save logic: RETURN now always logs the qso in SSB and in general 
  qso mode.
- New parameter: CHANGE_RST. If set in logcfg.dat, Pg-up and Pg-down will 
  change RST instead of CW speed if field is not empty. Default: off.
- fixed nasty bug which caused CQDELAY to start at 0 instead of the default 
  in logcfg.dat
- manpage updated for version 0.9.23

tlf-0.9.22
==========

This release fixes a bug to make it compatible with gcc-4.0 / AMD64

- The (local swedish) ssa_mt contest has changed its exchange format into 
  serial number + 4-character grid field. This made it necessary to make 
  a new parameter called SERIAL+GRID4. Tlf extracts the first 4 characters 
  for the multiplier. Input format:
  e.g. 001 JO21QI, the mult will be JO21. The rules file has also been updated.
- Man page updated for version 0.9.22.

tlf-0.9.21
==========

This release includes all the patches I received over the last 6 month. 
Besides making the code more stable, it will enable compilation with gcc 3.4. 
Further it should be compatible with cwdaemon-0.9 (weighting -50...50). 
I also got a patch to cure a problem with the qso logic, 2x escape will 
now reset the qso logic as soon as the call field is empty again.
TNX PG4I, VA3DB, OM4AA. 
Also the anonymous contributions I got through the bugtracker are very welcome!!

- Changes: 
- the cw sidetone setting (TONE) in logcfg.dat has become CWTONE=...
- a new parameter LOWBANDS_DOUBLE has been introduced (points x 2 for 40-80-160)
- a new parameter CLUSTER_LOG has been introduced. When set the cluster 
  messages are writteni to a 'clusterlog' file... this can be tailed to a 
  terminal window (tail -f clusterlog)
- the initial exchange function now also recognises embedded calls (PA/OK1RR/P)
- The logcfg.dat template has been updated to version 0.9.21.
- The manpage has been updated to version 0.9.21.

tlf-0.9.20
==========

- Bug fixed: In cw keyboard, ENTER produced a newline
- Bug fixed: In cw keyboard PgUp and PgDwn did not change the cw speed
- Bug fixed: The ';' was missing in "note-in-log" if the LAN was not active
- Bug fixed: Added <unistd.h>  to startmsg.c
- Bugs fixed: Buffer size handling in various places (tnx for the patch !!)
- Added OPEN BSD support to audio.c/h (tnx for the patch!)

- Added test version of CWBANDWIDTH=xxx to set bandwidth from Hamlib when 
  mode is switched:
	A value of 0 to switch off automatic mode switching
	A value of x for setting the bandwidth
	If the parameter is not there, PASSBAND_NORMAL is used (default)
This test version works for cw only.


tlf-0.9.19
==========

- Added INITIAL_EXCHANGE facility.
  Format: INITIAL_EXCHANGE=names.txt
  The file must contain a comma-separated list of exchanges, if e.g. the 
  exchange is the name of the operator:
  PA0R,rein
  PG4I,joop
  OK1RR,martin
  The file can be any length.
  If RECALL_MULTS is set, tlf will look in this list for the exchange and 
  fill it in for you.  There are various contests which have a standard 
  exchange, like e.g. the FOC Marathon.
- Doubled the arrays for the cty.dat list, to enable larger-than-standard 
  custom lists. Also set the max. number of mults to 500 per band (these 
  values can be set in tlf.h at compile time).
- The "note in log" (';') function will not indicate "Node 'X' , qsonumber" 
  if the LAN is not active. 

tlf-0.9.18
==========

Version 0.9.18 only adds native support for the ten tec ORION, to bridge 
the time until Hamlib has an approriate driver.
Use RIGMODEL=ORION if you have one. This works with or without Hamlib installed.
Set RIGSPEED=57600.
The driver uses the internal keyer of the ORION, so you don't need cwdaemon i
either (unless you use the tlf voice keyer which uses cwdaemon's PTT output, 
or an automatic antenna switch controlled by tlf).
- I also added a :debug_tty command to test rig links.

tlf-0.9.17
==========

- New sound record feature"
	New command :SOUnd
	F1 ... F12, s, c will record the voice keyer message for that key
	1:	Start contest recording to ddhhmm.au
	2:	Stop contest recording
	3:	Play back contest recording ddhh[mm][xx]
		xx is the offset from the start of the file e.g.:
		2110 will start from beginning of the day 21 hr 10:00 file.
		21100013:00 will start from day 21, hh 10, mm 00, + 13 minutes: 0 seconds
	To make sure you get a new file every hour make a cron job to run i
	every hour with:
		/usr/bin/pkill -f sox > /dev/null 2> /dev/null
	Once started the recorder will run until the lock file ~/.VRlock is 
	removed.

- Bug fixes from the EA RTTY test:
	Rtty miniterminal improved... wrote to :info, :packet and :help screens
	S&P mode sent no call with F1
- Added new command :RTTY. This one will switch the MFJ1278B controller 
  into RTTY mode.
-- Fixes from the WPX-SSB contest (PI4TUE):
	Operator got into log view (LESS) and could not get out:
		tlf will not go from edit into log view anymore (use :VIEW)
	Operator gives out wrong serial number after the run stn updates the i
	number:
		the serial number to be given is now printed prominently 
		below the call field.
- Added new parameter: CLUSTERLOGIN=pi4tue-1
	if this parameter is present tlf will automatically login a 
	telnet cluster using the call mentioned. This makes it easier for 
	non-linux users to start the program.

- :HELP will show a file 'help.txt' instead of the man page. This file can 
  be contest/operator specific. Make your own....
- Autocq: Tlf will stop sending as soon as a call is written into the call field
- Tlf will now send LSB or USB to the rig, depending on band. In RTTY mode 
  the rig stays in LSB, no matter which band.


tlf-0.9.15
==========

- Added support for MFJ1278B multi-mode controller.
	You can now use your MFJ1278B as a CW  output
	device with the same controls as for the software keyers
	(ctrl-k for keyboard mode, escape to leave keyboard mode, pgup
	for speed-up and pg-down for speed-down).

	The RTTY mode enables the RTTY contests with the same user
	interface as with the CW contests, also AMTOR is supported.

	New parameter for logcfg.dat: MFJ1278_KEYER=,
	e.g. MFJ1278_KEYER=/dev/ttyS0
	New characters for RTTY keyboard mode:
	'{' TX
	'}' RX
	'\' Enter Command Mode
	'K' <ENTER> Leave command mode.
	',' (comma) or Ctrl-k to go into keyboard mode
	ESCAPE to leave keyboard mode.
	The '{' and '}' characters can also be embedded in the Contest messages
	e.g. F1={RYRY TEST DE % % PSE K} will transmit the message and switch back to RX.

	New command ':MINiterm' to toggle a 5 x 40 char terminal window on/off.
	This will only work in DIG mode.

- Added experimental :SCAnner function (an idea of OK1RR)
	The SCAnner funtion combines the Frequency Control function of Hamlib
	with a rudimentary Audio S-Meter/plotter via the sound card. Just 
	connect the rx output to the soundcard input and you are o.k.
	Two functions are supported by version 0.9.15:

	Band Scan Function - can be used as a 'second hand' to scan a band 
	for activity with a separate receiver + computer.
	You give a Start frequency and a step frequency, and the "S-Meter" 
	values are plotted.

	SWR scan function - with a simple noise bridge and a computer 
	controlled rx as a frequenzy-stepped detector you can plot antenna 
	swr or filter transfer characteristic.

	New parameters for logcfg.dat:
	SC_DEVICE= Sound card device, e.g. SC_DEVICE=/dev/dsp0
	S_METER=  Calibration curve for the Audio S-Meter. As the audio 
	  volume depends on the transfer characteristic of your rx (incl. AGC) 
	  you have to calibrate the S-Meter. With this parameter you can 
	  create a curve with 20 points e.g.:
		S_METER=20,19,18,17,16,15,14,13,12,11,10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1
	  would create a linear curve with a max. value of 20. (Of course 
	  you will need	something logarithmic).
		Maximum value = 255 (8 bits).
	ESCAPE to go back to the previous level.

- Bug fixes by PA3FWM



tlf-0.9.11
==========

- Added support for Cwdaemon-0.8
	New parameters for logcfg.dat:
	- SOUNDCARD set sidetone output device to soundcard.
	- SIDETONE_VOLUME=<0 ... 99>  set sidetone volume on soundcard
- Changed auto-cq delay to 1/2 second increments.
- updated cty.dat file (11/15 version)
- added usa_canada_states file

tlf-0.9.10
==========

- Added SSBPOINTS= to set points per SSB qso

- Added CWPOINTS= to set points per CW qso

- Extended pr_hostaddress string to hold 47 characters (for long host names)
	(try TELNETHOST=claudia.esrac.ele.tue.nl
	TELNETPORT=8000)


tlf-0.9.9
=========

- Tlf now uses the original cty.dat file, not necessary to convert to ctydb.dat.

- Bug fix: KH2/KK2H and KK2H/KH2 now both in GUAM.

- Included the changes Bob N7XY made to cty.dat. Also added TO0O (in Martinique)

tlf-0.9.8
=========

- Changed time-to-live default for DX spots to 30 minutes. This can be changed 
  at compile time with the MAXMINUTES constant in cluster_bg.h

- Added station ID to log line when logging from differentl nodes in the 
  network.
  This enables post-contest analysis and log massage after the contest.
  CQWW_M2 must be set in logcfg.dat for this.

- Added qso number and NODE ID to note in log for post contest analysis.

- Added code to prevent double node id's in the network. If tlf hears it's 
  own node id on the network, it will ask for another one.

- Added :SYNc command, which will resync the logfile and recalculate the score
  without restarting the program. The automatic resync at program restart has
  been disabled, as it was generating too many problems. So the only way to
  resync the log is using the :SYNC command.

- Added :REScore command, which will recalculate the score without having to
  restart the program.

- Bug fix: /MM and /AM stations now have no country (no country multiplier
  value for cqww, only the zone), but do count for points. Tlf tries to
  calculate the continent from the zone. This is necessary to calculate the
  points.

tlf-0.9.7
=========

- Added new parameter for logcfg.dat:
	SYNCFILE=user:password@host/dir/syncfile (wget syntax).

  When you start tlf with this parameter in logcfg.dat tlf will wget the
  logfile from the relevant node, make a dated backup of your local logfile,
  and merge the 2 files. WARNING: this contains the password of the remote
  machine so I also:

- Added a new startup option for tlf: -s<remote file name> : 
    tlf -suser:password@host/dir/syncfile 
  will sync the local logfile at startup.

- Added parameter to change colors (defaults remain as usual):
	TLFCOLOR1=23		(Header and footer)
	TLFCOLOR2=67		(Pop up windows)
	TLFCOLOR3=70		(Log window)
	TLFCOLOR4=57		(Markers/dupe colour)
	TLFCOLOR5=43		(Input fields)
	TLFCOLOR6=70		(Window frames)
	The numbers in octal, fg/bg or bg/fg (you have to try it).
  You should only specify these if you don't agree with the standard colours 
  of tlf.

- Call edit mode is now default INSERT mode (log edit remains OVERWRITE mode).

- Bug fix: CE0Y/SP9DTP was wrongly located in Poland (also works for VP2E now :-)

tlf-0.9.6
=========

- 2 x escape in the exchange field will return to call field and clear it.

- Patch for configure.in to enable build under BSD (warning: tlf segfaults
  under BSD, the cause is being investigated). Tnx Joop PG4I

- Changed cabrillo for serial + section multiplier (e.g. ssa mt contest)

- Patch from LU4HKN to change version automatically in cabrillo file

- Patch from Stephane F8CFE to add new parameter for rig control:
	RIGCONF=civaddr=0x40,retry=3,rig_pathname=/dev/ttyS0
	which will send rig configuration info to Hamlib.

- Added new parameter for logcfg.dat:
	SYNCFILE=user:password@host/dir/syncfile (wget syntax).

  When you start tlf with this parameter in logcfg.dat tlf will wget the
  logfile from the relevant node, make a dated backup of your local logfile,
  and merge the 2 files. WARNING: this contains the password of the remote
  machine so I also:

- Added a new startup option for tlf: -s<remote file name> :
	tlf -suser:password@host/dir/syncfile will sync the local logfile at startup.

- Added parameter to change colors (defaults remain as usual):
	TLFCOLOR1=23		(Header and footer)
	TLFCOLOR2=67		(Pop up windows)
	TLFCOLOR3=70		(Log window)
	TLFCOLOR4=57		(Markers/dupe colour)
	TLFCOLOR5=43		(Input fields)
	TLFCOLOR6=63		(Window frames)
	The numbers in octal, fg/bg or bg/fg (you have to try it).
	You should only specify these if you don't agree with the standard colours of tlf.

- Call edit mode is now default INSERT mode (log edit remains OVERWRITE mode).

- Bug fix: CE0Y/SP9DTP was wrongly located in Poland (also works for VP2E now :-)



tlf-0.9.5
=========

- added SSA_MT contest (beta...)

- added capital 'Y' to exit check.

- added new parameter: NO_BANDSWITCH_ARROWKEYS
	this will prevent unwanted band switching when you are not using
	rig control. Band up=alt-b, band down = alt-v (Trlog compatible).
	
- bug fix: qso number was increased on "notes" line

- bug fix: zone number was overwritten by the network

- bug fix: table overrun in packet modules when too many spots/h came in
	caused segfault.

tlf-0.9.4
=========

- added band output routine for cwdaemon-0.7.
	New parameter: BANDOUTPUT to switch it on.
	Cwdaemon-0.7 will output band info on pins 2, 7,8 and 9 of the
	parallel port. 160m = 1, 80m = 2 .... 10m = 9. This is compatible with 
	commercial band decoders. 	
	You can also use different coding:
	BANDOUTPUT=12484848 will put pin 9 high to switch your 3-bander etc... 
	no need for a decoder, a few relays will do... unless you also want 
	to switch your bandfilters.
	
- known bugs: 
	tlf seg faults when switching from the NEEDED band map to the 
	spot list with very large band maps (the 10m bandmap had 150 entries 
	during cqwwssb sunday afternoon)
	ce0y/sp9spt shows up as Poland instad of Easter Island...

tlf-0.9.3
=========

- Bug fix: Speed setting from logcfg.dat erratic. Changed parameter to
	CWSPEED=xx (was SPEED=xx).
	
- Bug fix: The auto cq function could not be stopped with ESCAPE

- Changed parameter input for TNCPORT and RIGPORT. The parameters now
  accept direct path entry: e.g. RIGPORT=/dev/ttyS0 or TNCPORT=/dev/ttyUSB1.
  Tnx ZL2BSJ for the help. This adds USB capability to tlf...

- Added parameter NOAUTOCQ which switches off the auto_cq function

- Added parameter SSBMODE to start tlf in ssb mode (does not switch the rig).

- Added possibility to have several logcfg.dat files:
  Start tlf with tlf -f<filename>. You can now have different configurations
  per operator. e.g. tlf -fPA0RCT, tlf -fHB9FBL etc...
  Tlf first looks at the -f parameter, and expects the file in the
  working directory (e.g. /home/yourcall/contest/2003/cqwwcw/logcfg.dat).
  The default filename is logcfg.dat. If there is no config file in the
  working directory tlf opens PACKAGE_DATA_DIR/logcfg.dat, READ ONLY (often
  needs root privileges).
  You will need to change the call and other parameters on that one.
	
- :HELp now displays the manpage.

- :INFo now also displays the relevant filenames, addresses, and ports.


tlf-0.9.2
=========

- Added Adif export capability. The command :ADIf will write the logfile i
  properly (I hope) formatted to a file with a .adif suffix.

- Fixed bug in cqww contest: when a new spot arrived the cq zone would be
  changed.

- Added new method to handle contest rules (by LZ3NY): 

  You can put general parameters, which are the same for all contests (call,
  keyer speed, window handling etc.) into logcfg.dat.  Put
  CONTEST=<contest_name> into logcfdg.dat.

  Tlf now first looks if there is a directory "rules/" in the working
  directory, e.g. /home/yourcall/tlf/2003/cqwwcw. It then loads the file
  <contest_name> 	which contains the 	rules for that contest. If the
  directory "rules/" is not available there, tlf will look into
  /usr/local/share/tlf/rules, and try to load the file <contest_name> from
  there. If not available tlf will set the contest to "qso".

  This will make it easier to publish the rules files for various contests.  If
  you programmed and tested a new contest, please send the rules file to
  PA0R@EUDXF.ORG so I can add it to the distribution.

- Added support for MC editor (by LZ3NY)

- Added QUIT command (by LZ3NY)

- Added WAZMULT (by LZ3NY). Uses Cqzone as multiplier.

- Added ITUMULT (by LZ5NY). Uses ITUzone as multiplier

- Added CQDELAY parameter for setting cqdelay in logcfg.dat (by LZ3NY)

- Added PFX_MULT (works like in wpx)

- Added Dynamic check for users terminal type (defaults to rxvt) (by LZ3NY).

- Added experimental support for xterm. Sometimes xterm starts with the wrong
  keyboard map. This is the case when the arrow keys don't work. Remedy
  (workaround) is to first switch into the shell (with "!") and back to tlf
  (with "exit"). The arrow keys as well as the function keys will now work in
  most cases. Please report irregularities to PA0R@EUDXF.ORG, I don't expect it
  to work everywhere. Also the color scheme is the best I could do with the
  standard colours of xterm. I prefer rxvt!

- Changed cw keyer speed control back to pg-up/pg-down. Alt-v will only work in
  CT compatibility mode.

- Changed cqdelay control to ctrl-pgup/ctrl-pgdown. Ctrl-pgup is not possible
  with TERM=linux, so I had to add a command :CQDelay which will do the same.

- Added band switch control with Alt-v and Alt-b (to be compatible with TRLog),
  right/left arrow will work also

- Added Alt-e control to enter edit qso's mode (to be compatible with TRLog),
  up-arrow will work also.

tlf-0.9.1
=========

- Added PFX_MULT, wpx-style multiplier.

- Added RXVT parameter (logcfg.dat) which sets the colours for using tlf in an
  rxvt terminal.

tlf-0.9.0
==========

- Added experimental voice keyer support for soundcards, based on the sox
  package.  The voice keyer works as soon as the mode is SSB and you have
  nominated at least 1 sound file.

- added parameters to logcfg.dat for the voice keyer. They are e.g.:

#

- You have to make your files off line. As tlf uses sox, most audio files can
  be played.

- You can test the voice keyer capability with "play audiofile.xx".  If that
  works you are o.k. I have used sox-12.17 for testing.

- The voice keyer uses the same qso logic as TRlog in cw, you only have to say
  the call and press ENTER twice... (if the exchange is standard, like in the
  cqww)

- If you want to use the PTT line, the cwdaemon must run as well.

- You have to invent your own hardware interface to the trx (there are numerous
  examples floating around the net...)

** comments please **

tlf-0.8.23
==========
- bug fix: zone could not be changed from default in cqww


tlf-0.8.22
==========

- Added -x option to use rxvt colours and keys.

- Changed sections exchange check routine to accept 1 character mults.

- Updated manpage

tlf-0.8.21
==========

- Added TXDELAY (Turn On Delay) control for cwdaemon.
	The value of TOD from logcfg.dat is sent to the keyer at startup.
	Value range is 0 ... 50 ms (0 switches PTT off completely)
	
- Added Alt-t command for TUNE  (stops with any key)

- Added Alt-p command for PTT on|off

- Added Ctrl-r command to switch lp0-pin 14 on|off (SSB mic|SSS Soundcard)

- Some cosmetic changes to the Alt-w (weight) dialogue


tlf-0.8.20
==========

- Made tlf compatible wit hamlib-1.1.4 (new rig.h).

- Added fast startup (now default).

- Verbose startup with -v option

- Version output with -V option

- Debug mode with -d option (to check rigctl)

- Added dialogue window for CW speed and weight setting (Alt-v and Alt-w).

- Bug fixes for DX_&_SECTIONS multiplier for ARRL and CQ 160 meter contests
	(incl. cabrillo output).
	
- Added manpage (tlf.1)

tlf-0.8.19
==========

- Added flexible point parameters for logcfg.dat (tnx for contribution Mitko,
  LZ3NY):

	COUNTRYLIST=SP_DX:SP	List of countries that have exceptional points.
			Format e.g. NRAUTEST:OH,OH0,OJ0M,SM,OZ,OY,OX etc...
  You can also give a file name, and put the country information into a file 
  (same format).
		
	COUNTRY_LIST_POINTS=5	All countries in the list get 5 points
		
	USE_COUNTRYLIST_ONLY	Only countries in the list get (5) points,
				all others 0.
		
	MY_COUNTRY_POINTS=1		My own country gets 1 point
	MY_CONTINENT_POINTS=2		Other countries in my continent get 
					2 points
	DX_POINTS=10			DX countries get 10 points
		
  The above only takes care of the points, not the multipliers!!
  You can combine this system with e.g. a WYSIWYG_MULTIBAND  or a COUNTRY_MULT,
  a MULT_LIST or SECTIONS.
		
  Please try this well before the contest, so there is still time to
  make changes if needed!!

- Added possibility to give > 9 points (e.g. CQWW-160m)

- Added weight control (Alt-w) for netkeyer (-5 ... 5)

- Tlf now sends weight from logcfg.dat to netkeyer at startup

- Tlf now sends speed from logcfg.dat to netkeyer at startup

- Startup works faster at restart

  COLUMNS > 80

- shift_F1...F8 now starts change message for F1...F8 (shift_function key may
  not work at some terminals!!)

- MARKERS=<path_to_markerfile> writes a marker file for Xplanet, containing the
  last 8 entries to the spot list or the bandmap (whichever is active).



tlf-0.8.14
========

- added section mult capability (exchange = mult = section from file)

tlf-0.8.13
========

- reworked bandmap.  Goto bandmap with "." or "Alt_," switch between "all"  and
  "needed" with "." scroll with up/down and pg-up/pgdown, leave with ESC.

- colour coding for bandmap (only works for contest bands).

- grab spot (ctrl-g) with empty call field takes last one in spot list

tlf-0.8.10a
=========

- fixed bug "tlf does not start without a logfile" 


tlf-0.8.10
========

Bug/unwanted feature fixes:

- when adding a note ';', it kills the data in the current QSO field

- when deleting last QSO '-', and the last QSO was a Note,
  QSO's in SCORE window is wrong (QSO's count decremented while it
  shouldn't)

- when call field is empty, is TAB suposed to give a zone?

- when editing last QSO '@', if I go right (with -> key) till end of line,
  I'm stuck on next line. Acutally, If you enter "ggggggggggggggggggggggggg"
  past the end of line, it will overflow to the next line. And there's no
  solution to go back (ESC and :edit to fix it though) But the screen looks
  ugly in the mean time.

- tlf does not handle very well bogus .log text files.
  mostly FIXED, needs more work

- entering edit last '@', and add an extra 9 to 59 report (I know this is
  silly in SSB mode), you can replace the char but you cannot suppr the
  extra 9 (either with del or backspace).

- when editing call field with left key, it gets green on orange.
  but when I do a replace (overwrite a char), the field looses color
  back to yellow on blue, but I'm still in edit mode!

- disable "ZONEDISPLAY is 1" message on ":zone" cmd

- allow ENTER key in exchange field

- backspace in edit field mode

tlf-0.8.9   Beta for CT adepts.....
=======

- after making some 3000 qso's with CT at CT9L in the cqww I added the most
important CT commands to tlf. See the new Alt-H command for details...

- The up-arrow will now lead into the qso  editor as requested by CT freaks...

- The CW keyer speed can be adjusted with Alt-V or from within the keyboard routine
(Alt-K, ctrl-K or ,), with up/down arrow.

- For CT compatibility mode (use Insert and + for running) uncomment the
CTCOMPATIBLE command in logcfg.dat.  There is NO S&P mode, and Enter will log the qso.
(But you asked for it...)


tlf-0.8.7
=======

- added time sync protocol for networked nodes.

- add TIME_MASTER to logcfg.dat for the master station.

- the "@" command now allows to edit the qso's visible (5 qso's).  During edit
mode LAN receive is stopped. Leave edit mode with enter, tab or esc.

- changed insert mode for call edit.

	-       Zone correction in exchange field (04 3 )
	- 	Call correction in exchange field (04 W7KJ ) when CALLUPDATE is set in logcfg.dat
	-	D4B, VP2E, VP2M, VP2V, PY0FF, NP2, WP2 now correctly scored
	-	R1ANZ is now CE9 in zone 29
	-	TA1 is correctly placed in zone 20 (EU)
	-	W2XXX/TI8 now handled correctly
	-	Fixed segmentation fault when too many input chars in input field
	-       Right tlf version in cabrillo file
	-	Edit last qso can now be closed also with enter and tab.

tlf-0.8.5
=======

- added parameter TIME_OFFSET= to logcfg.dat. It enables you to use the computer
at local time, while tlf logs in utc. Use any value between -23 ... 23. In PA0 the value is -1 for
winter time.

- in cqww in-country qso's count 0 points also in NA.


tlf-0.8.4 beta for arrl sweepstakes
=======

============================================

- all rig control related functions were changed to work with hamlib-1.1.3

- just compile hamlib-1.1.3 (./configure, make, make install, that's all!!)

- this tlf version needs hamlib-1.1.3 library. You may have to do /sbin/ldconfig ,
    so tlf can find the lib at startup !!

- tested o.k. for the omni 6 plus. For the rit of the omni and icom rigs you need a patch.

- grab spot (ctrl-G) only works in band map

- add spot (ctrl-A) adds call in call field to bandmap

- frequency conrol (ctrl-F): up/down arrow for 100 Hz, left/right arrow 20 Hz steps.
	escape goes back to normal mode
