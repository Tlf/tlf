tlf-1.4.1
=========

Bug fixes and minor improvements. 

Changes:
    - From TLF-1.3.1 on we can use the CT9 cty.dat files with full call sign
      exceptions (marked by =<call>).
      Starting from Jan2020 Jim Reiser AD1C presents the CT9 format file as
      default file format for TLF. If you use TLF-1.3.0 or older you should
      look for the old format files.
    - Rework display of partials - more stations displayed, bugs fixed
      (tnx HA5CQZ)
    - Log will automatically be rescored after deleting a QSO 
    - Update ADIF write function to V3.10

New features:
    - Add rules, multipliers and initial exchange for OKOM contest (tnx
      SP3RXO)
    - Add rules and initial exchange for CWOPS minitest (tnx Joop PG4I)
    - TLF supports now the 60m band (Tnx Joerg DL8DTL).
    - Drop hard coded editor programs. You can name any editor program 
      to use in the EDITOR= keyword. If none set TLF uses the $EDITOR 
      from environment.
      The Logfile gets automatically reloaded after editing.
    - HA5CQZ provided a good solution to extend the memory TX functionality.
      Besides frequency the memory now also remembers the working mode.
      That allows to just grab a announced station, work it in S&P mode and
      switch back to running CQ on your old QRG with very few key strokes.
      From the commit message:
        "In addition to the frequency memory now holds the mode (CQ/SP) and
         the entered call (if any)
	    - % swaps TRX and MEM (swap)
	    - $ moves MEM to TRX (pop)
	    - in SP mode Shift-F1 makes a swap if memory holds a 
	      previous CQ frequency and then executes F1 (calls CQ).  
 	Mode and entered call are also restored.  

	After the "switch back" using Shift-F1 the previous frequency and
	entered call are not lost, pressing % restores the state, so one can
	continue SP and also move around or grab new stations."

Bug fixes:
    - There are two major fixes for bugs in the scoring logic:
      - For US/VE stations running ARRLDX contest intra W/VE qso were counted
	which was wrong. New code correctly scores these contacts with 0
	points and does not count it as multi.
      - If you running TLF in CQWW 2 TX mode QSO from other stations on LAN
	would be counted wrong. Fixed.
    - Fix a lot of minor inconsistencies in handling of keyer, partial display
      and other (Mostly done by HA5CQZ)
    - Fix handling of CT compatible keys and correct handling of CTCOMPATIBLE
      keyword (tnx N0NB) 
    - Add missing generated_defs.pl to distributed files. Need for
      regeneration of test code.
    - Fix compile errors with GCC-10.

      
tlf-1.4.0
=========

Major release

Besides some fixed bugs and a lot of internal improvements it provides 
some new features:

Major changes:
    - Make compiling with hamlib library mandatory and change all internal 
      frequency representation to freq_t type.
    - Old SCAN functionality got dropped from code, as it was no longer
      working.
    - Correct color display for TERM=xterm-256color 

New features:
    - Allow using of aliases in multiplier file (Tnx for suggesting to N0NB).
      See discussion of MULT_FILE in man page for details.
    - Added CALLMASTER= keywords to allow naming the callmaster database file
      (default is still 'callmaster')
    - Repaired old CQWW simulator code (see :sim in man page)
    - Keep the content of the exchange field if not empty even if RECALL_MULTS
      is set - actual input gets precedence over stored 'old' data.
    - Allow vertical resizing of TLF window (before start and/or during use)
    - Rework the startup code for better readability by users
      * 'verbose' startup waits for key press before clearing the screen
      * If started in empty directory (new contest or first start) switch to
        verbose mode automatically.

Bug fixes:
    - Correct transposition of check and section for arrlss (Tnx N0NB)
    - Added some more test programs
    - Fix bug when calling editlog(),

Major release.

Besides some fixed bugs and a lot of internal improvements it provides 
some new features:

Bugfixes:
    - Fixed wrong parsing of EXCLUDE_MULTILIST keyword.
    - Fixed recognition of CQ zone for 1Axxx stations.

New features:
    - Allow direct use of fldigis XMLRPC interface for receiving and sending
      digimode data. See doc/READMA_RTTY.txt and man page for details. 
      Tnx Ervin HA2OS. (The old GMFSK interface to fldigi is still available
      but will be dropped in next versions).
    - New keyword MINITEST to support Minitest like contests, where you can
      operate the same station each time in one of two or more time
      intervals. Tnx HA2OS.
    - New multi keyword UNIQUE_CALL_MULTI for Minitest or CWops CWT contest.
      Allows to count unique call signs as multi for all band or per band.
      Tnx HA2OS.

    - Fix bandmap display if grabbed station is very near to other ones
      in bandmap. Tnx Fred DH5FS.

tlf-1.2.4.3
===========

New feature:
    - QTC_RECV_LAZY keyword. Setting it skips check of received QTC records
      for completion. Useful during rx if you record the audio during qso
      and complete the QTC records later.

tlf-1.2.4.2
===========

Bugfix release.

Bug fixes:
    - fix some memory and resource leaks in seldom used functions

Enhancements:
    - Update and fix spelling errors in man page
    - Cleanup some code in CW sending logic
    - Align hamlib's passband argument to new macro: RIG_PASSBAND_NORMAL 
      (provided by the coming hamlib-3.1). That allows to switch 
      frequency without changing the rig passband settings.

tlf-1.2.4.1
===========

Bug fixes:
    - Fix a possible buffer overflow in addmult2 due to strncpy

tlf-1.2.4
=========

Maintenance and bugfix release.

New features since tlf-1.2.3:
    - Switch hardcoded keyboard handling which supported only xterm, linux 
      terminal and rxvt to use of ncurses keypad(). That way other terminal
      settings should be supported as well (Tnx to Nate N0NB for the work).
    - Extend bandmap functionality. See man page for details
      (tnx to Ervin HA2OS).
      * Setting BMAUTOADD in logcfg.dat simplify the adding of heard stations 
        to the bandmap list. Just type in the call and as soon as you turn of 
	to another frequency the call gets added to the bandmap (similar 
	to Ctl-A).
      * If BMAUTOGRAB is set in logcfg.dat Tlf will automatically grab a 
        call from the bandmap list and put it in the call input field if 
	you tune in next to the station. You can just start working it 
	in S&P by pressing ENTER. 

Bug fixes:
    - Cleanup some valgrind warnings about possible memory leaks.
    - Fix autoconf settings for new lookup of ncurses include files
    - Fix a segmentation fault if we have unexpected long call sign prefixes

tlf-1.2.3
=========
Maintenance and bugfix release.

New features since tlf-1.2.2:
    - Support for ARRL 160m contest (tnx N0NB)
    - Search MULT_LIST file not only in working directory but also in
      install directory, e.g. /wusr/local/share/tlf (tnx N0NB)
    - Better calculation of working QRG for RTTY qso's according to the used 
      rig modulations (USB/LSB/FSK) (tnx HA2OS)
    - Automatic recognition of ncurses install directories (esp. for OpenSUSE)
      (tnx N0NB)

Bug fixes:
    - Bandmap gets saved even if bandmap is not displayed every 10s. 
    - Fix calculation of remaining spot time for saved badnmap data 
      if tlf is restarted
    - Fix time update if auto_cq is running.
    - fixed multi counting for ARRL-SS
    - Fixed multi counting for SERIAL&SECTION keyword.
    - Old multi counting code did not correctly differentiate between 
      similar ARRL sections like NE and ONE for DX_&_SECTIONS. Fixed.
    - Corrected WYSIWYG multi scoring coming in via LAN.

tlf-1.2.2
=========
Maintenance and bugfix release.

Contains all bugfixes and enhancements from tlf-1.2.2_pre versions (read below)

New features since tlf-1.2.2_pre2:
    - TLF can now write cabrillo files for WAEDC contest
    - bandmap display
      * does not show QRG if no active rig control is in use
      * The actual bandmap list will be saved every 10s. Using this 
        information the last bandmap state will be reconstructed after 
	a restart of TLF.
    - FAQ
      * Add instructions about refreshing callmaster database and cty.dat
        file
    - update CTY.DAT and callmaster database
    - Improvements to callmaster database handling
      * callmaster database can now contain comment lines starting with '#'
      * Drop size restrictions of the number of calls in the database

Bug fixes:

    * Fix some minor bugs in WAEDC code for RTTY

tlf-1.2.2_pre2
==============

New features:
    - Improved bandmap display 
      * display actual QRG on bandmap
      * center bandmap around QRG
      * update bandmap every second
      * do not show WARC spots in contest mode

    Improvements to WAEDC QTC handling (by HA2OS)
    - allow a list of stations known to give QTC's (maybe from last year)
	  QTC_CAP_CALLS=QTC_calls.txt
      If you use this option, then Tlf will put a "P" flag (means "previous") 
      near known station from the list on bandmap, and in worked window.
      Eg: 7001.0 * R9AA P
    - new QTC capable flags: 'L': 'later', 'N': 'NO' 
      You can mark a station on the bandmap for QTC "L"ater or "N"o QTC 
      with Ctrl-L and CTRL-N respective. Flags will automatically deleted 
      as soon as you get at least one QTC from the station.
      The flags will be stored in a separated file, called
      QTC_meta.log. If you exit from Tlf, and you start it again
      later, the marked information will be available.
    - stations which can give still more QTC's will not be marked as 
      dupe on the bandmap
    - Set QTC_AUTO_FILLTIME keyword in logcfg.dat to automatically fill in the 
      the hour for the QTC time 
      (Some stations send only a short time format, e.g. "34 DL3XYZ 9999").
      CTRL-F just fills in the last received hour if QTC_AUTO_FILLTIME 
      is not enabled.
    - You can use ENTER or SPACE to advance between fields in the QTC window.
    - manually start and stop QTC recording with CTRL-R in QTC window,

Bug fixes:

    - Fix some problems with using LAN mode for WAEDC


tlf-1.2.2_pre1
==============

New Features:
    - Two new contests are supported 'All Asian DX' and 'WAEDC' (both provided
      by HA2OS) For WAEDC details please see 'doc/README_QTC.txt'.
    - some new keywords for scoring (by HA2OS)
      (read man page for details)
      PFX_MULT_MULTIBAND allows multi scoring for prefixes per ban
      better continent handling with CONTINENTLIST, CONTINENT_LIST_POINTS
      and USE_CONTINENTLIST_ONLY.
      BANDWEIGHT_MULTIS and BANDWEIGHT_POINTS  per band weight for points
      and multis
      EXCLUDE_MULTILIST and PFX_NUM_MULTI 
    - tlf now send '5nn nr' if you repeat the nr after the QSO (provided
      by DH5FS)
    - Update of the  manual page to current conventions (by N0NB)
    - autosend now allows a manual start (see man page).  
    - You can use a custom S&P message instead of the autogenerated
      one. See S&P_CALL_MSG in man page
    - tlf reads the audio frequency offset from fldigi via 
      xmlrpc (you have to configure with '--enable-fldigi-xmlrpc' and
      install XMLRPC-C to use that feature) (by HA2OS).
    - the CW keyer is now in an popup window 
    - new startup argument: '-r', which disables radio control (HA2OS)


Bug fixes
    - Fix scoring and display of multis from ITUMULT and WAZMULT keyword
    - Fix some memory leaks
    - Seek gMFSK.log to the end of file, when Tlf starts
    - backport some patches from the Debian distribution
    - Convert the given callsign from logcfg.dat (CALL=...) always to upper
      case. 


tlf-1.2.1
=========
Minor maintenance and bugfix release.

New features:
    - New config option SERIAL_OR_SECTION (see man page)
    - New placeholder '!' for CW ad RTTY macros (received exchange)
    - Additional display of WARC bands in searchwindow if mode is QSO
      or DXPED (tnx HA2OS).
    - Use '?' during call input if call not complete or sure. It now
      immediately sends the call fragment followed by '?' 

Bug fixes:
    - Fix problem with tcvr control for rigs where rig_get_vfo() in
      hamlibs rig backend is not implemented (tnx HA2OS)
    - add missing documentation for some configuration parameters to man 
      page
    - correct segfault in string handling code for RTTY
    - correct focm.c to allow use of <glib-2.32.4
    - some ncurses libraries (e.g. on OpenSUSE) are not able to allocate 
      a second newterm() for packet mode. Added a workaround.

Thanks for help and input from OK1RR, DH5YM, DH5FS, HA2OS, N0NB and others.

New features:
    - finish new CABRILLO handling (see doc/README.cabrillo for details)
      * supports CABRILLO v3
      * extensible format
    - Allow editing of exchange field

    - Reworked autosend feature
      * starts sending call automatically after entering 2..5 characters
        of the call in RUN mode
      * Enable it via ':char' command (accepts 0 (off) or 2..5 as 
        number of characters before autosend start).
      * shorter calls have to be finished with ENTER key 
      * calculates the expected time to send the call from cw speed and 
        switches to sending exchange after that time is reached
      * A progress indicator shows the characters already sent.
      * SPACE and DOWN no longer starts autosend feature, but jumps to 
        exchange field
    - New cty.dat and new calmaster database. Tnx HA2OS.
    - Provide a standard 'help.txt' file. Tnx DH5FS.
      Can be overwritten with your own one in working directory.

      Tnx DH5FS.


Bug fixes:
    - Ctrl-k start keyer also in exchange field
    - Contest rules will be reread after edit of logcfg.dat with :SET or :CFG
    - Fix display of contest statistics 
      * Q/M now correct and with one digit after decimal point
      * show band rate only if more than ten QSOs on band
    - Fix display of worked countries for CQWW
    - Improved handling of problems with rig link
    - Initialise tlf's node designator (THISNODE=...) to 'A' even when no
      LAN is used (needed for bandmap output)
    - Do not send empty CW or Digimode messages (avoiding turning on and 
      off the transmitter). Tnx HA2OS
    - Fix wrong order of tests for mult counting (DX_&_SECTIONS has 
      precedence over MULT_LIST in UNIVERSAL contests). Tnx W3NR and DH5FS.
    - Drop unused keyword '2EU3DX_POINTS'


tlf-1.1.6
=========
Minor maintenance and bugfix release.

New features:
    - Reduce minimal lifetime for bandmap entries to 30s (requested by DH5YM)
    - Update ARRL Field Day rules and arrlsections file. Tnx Nate N0NB.
    - New NO_RST keyword (backported from from tlf-1.2.0 branch). Use it for
      contests which do not exchange and record RS/RST (e.g. ARRL Field Day 
      or CW Open)  
       * do not add RST into log and do not show RST if NO_RST is set, just 
         add '---' instead  

Bug fixes:
    - Correct GPL boilerplate in all source files. Tnx Nate N0NB.
    - QSO points were not written for WYSIWYG_ONCE multis.
    - ADIF and cabrillo files missed QSOs for some or all WARC bands. 
      (Even if no WARC bands should be used in contests we add the correct 
      frequency output for these bands now)
    - fix recognition of ARRL Field day rules (changed rule file to name
      it 'arrl_fd').


tlf-1.2.0_pre3
==============
Prerelease and test version

tlf-1.2.0 will be a major release with some new features and improvements.
tlf-1.2.0_pre3 should test some more of them.

Contains all bug fixes and enhancements from 1.1.4 and 1.1.5.

New features since 1.2.0_pre2:
    - Major rework how to write of cabrillo logfiles. Old code 
      contained some errors and was not easily extendable to new contests 
      with different cabrillo formats.
      New routine formats cabrillo log according to a textual description
      (Which can be modified and extended by the user) in 
      /usr/(local/)share/cabrillo.fmt. See doc/README.cabrillo for details.


tlf-1.1.5
=========
Minor maintenance release.

New features:
    - Report line number for badly formatted lines in initial exchange file.
      That makes it easier to find the problem for files with a lot of entries.
      Thanks Mario DH5YM for reporting the problem.
    - Allow to set SIDETONE_VOLUME to 0 independent from chosen sidetone
      device. Due to a bug in cwdaemon-0.9.4 setting SIDETONE to 0 switches
      off the sidetone but also the keying. So please...
      !!! Set SIDETONE_VOLUME = 0 to switch off sidetone output !!!

Bug fixes:
    - Fix display of zone and section in searchlog window
    - Correct handling of function keys to send messages in digimode.
      Old code allowed function keys only during call input. New code supports
      them also in exchange field.


tlf-1.1.4
=========
Minor maintenance release.

New features:
    - ask for confirmation about reported problems in config files to give
      you time to recognize the problems.
    - Rework of digimode handling together with fldigi.
      Fix digimode receive routine 'rx_rtty()', make miniterm output more
      robust and update miniterm also while the cursor is in the exchange
      field. Drop some unneeded newlines for each function key macro.
    - Minor corrections and additions to the man page

Bug fixes:
    - Old version segfaults in 'searchlog' function if a really long callsign
      filled the input field.
    - Parsing logic for special characters in own exchange (# ...) do not rely
      anymore on a trailing NL to the exchange macro.
    - Fix sidetone control. Recognize CWTONE=0 in logcfg.dat, work around a
      bug in cwdaemon which does not allow to switch tone back on afterwards.
    - Stop flickering cursor between input or exchange field and dupe
      searchwindow.
    - Fix Alt-t (tune) function to switch tuning on for 6 seconds (can be
      stopped early with any key press). !!Be aware that there are some
      problems in different cwdaemon versions (no PTT keying, no chance to stop
      tuning early, ...). Working with the maintainer to fix it.


tlf-1.1.3
tlf-1.2.0_pre2
==============
Bugfix release.

Old tlf-1.1.2 contained a bug in the parsing logic for logcfg.dat and rules
files. It failed to recognize some keywords if there was a similar one with
the same beginning (e.g. CLUSTERLOGIN got not recognized as there is also a
CLUSTER keyword). i
Furthermore it complained about empty lines in that files with: 'Keyword '' 
not supported'.
Thanks to David N1EA and Marting OK1RR for pointing that out.

New features:
    - New keyword CABRILLO=<formatname> accepted. specifies the cabrillo format 
      to be used (not working yet).

Bug fixes:
    - Implemented new and much more robust parsing logic for keywords.
      Reworked and rechecked also all parameter handling to allow a better 
      failure handling.
    - tlf no longer complains about empty lines in config files.
    - Add support for '~' expansion for '-f' command line switch. (Thanks N1EA).
      Something like 'tlf -f~/mydir/logcfg.dat' is working now.
    - Add description of reset of CW bandwidth during band switch and 
      CWBANDWIDTH= keyword to man page.

Furthermore some cleanup and internal changes are made to simplify future 
maintenance, e.g.:
    - Cleanup of unused variables and comments.
    - Rename 'configure.in' into 'configure.ac' as former will be no longer
      accepted by automake-1.13


tlf-1.2.0_pre1
==============
Prerelease for new tlf-1.2.0

tlf-1.2.0 will be a major release with some new features and improvements. 
The prerelease should test some first main features.

New features:
    - change log file format to make room for recording of actual working
      frequency (columns 0..79 - old TR-log format, QRG gets added with
      one decimal after that)
    - Better check of log file format on startup. Can migrate old logs to
      new format.
    - Record actual working QRG in log if a rig is connected
    - Write QRG into ADIF and Cabrillo export files
    - Renamed ADIF and Cabrillo files to <call>.adi and <contest>.cbr as
      suggested by Martin OK1RR
    - Check for size of Terminal (at least 25x80 is needed).

Furthermore a lot of cleanup and internal changes are made to simplify future 
maintenance, e.g.:
    - A new scheme for color initialisation and naming
    - Cleanup of unused variables and comments.
    - Fix configure-script to abort if no ncurses lib is installed.

To be done:
    - Fix generation of cabrillo files (still broken in this prerelease)
    - Document log file format
    - make exchange field editable


tlf-1.1.2
=========
Minor maintenance release.

New features:
    - Add ARRL 10m Contest rules for DX stations.
    - Provide more actual multiplier files for arrldx and arrl10m contests.
    - Add a better recognition of unknown keywords in config file.

Bug fixes:
    - Fix recongnition of COUNTRYLIST keyword.
    - fix a segfault problem in exchange handling.

tlf-1.1.1
=========
Minor maintenance release.

New features:
    - New doc/README.ssb gives some good hints how to use TLF on SSB contest.
      Thanks Andy, G4KNO for contributing.

Bug fixes:
    - Fix spelling of unmute command in scripts/play_vk. Tnx G4KNO
    - Make sure that no packet related functions get called if started 
      with 'tlf -n'
    - Fix segfault during build of logline if not in contest mode - esp.
      'RULES=qso'
    - Fix display of background for partials when leaving call edit mode

tlf-1.1.0
=========

Major release. Besides a lot of fixed bugs it provides some new features and 
internal improvements.
Thanks to all of you for pointing out bugs, submitting ideas and testing.
To name some without any order of ranks: Ben NJ8J, Martin OK1RR, Fred DM3MF,i
Andy G4KNO, Rob N6ROB and Graham VE3GTC. 

New features:
    - move tlf sources to public github repository (http://github.com/TLF/tlf)

    - implement a new bandmap function (see doc/New_Bandmap.txt for details)
      * move score display in upper right corner of display to make room for 
        the bandmap
      * Ctrl-A adds an observed station as spot to the bandmap and 
        broadcasts it to other stations in the LAN
      * Drop old SPOTLIST display (superseded by new bandmap)

    - changes in logcfg.dat handling !Fix your contest rules!
      * allow >9 points for any point scoring 
      * drop old unneeded keywords (MANY_CALLS, SPOTLIST, FILTER)
      * fixed keywords for CQ_TU_MSG, VKCQM and VKSPM according to manual
      * BANDMAP=<xxx>,<nn> allows configuration of the new bandmap display 
        (see man page)

    - Send VKCQM and VKSPM voice messages after end of QSO in SSB. 
    - Use external user adaptable script 'play_vk' for playing of 
      SSB voice key messages

    - add list of 'usa_canada' states and general 'contest' rules file 
      to installation files

    - drop special handling for TenTec ORION (correctly handled by hamlib in 
      meantime)

    - changed handling of comments for WYSIWYG_ONCE and WYSIWYG_MULTI
      Old code stopped multi recognition at first space in comment string. 
      Changed to use whole string but strip trailing spaces. Was so back 
      before tlf-0.9.21

    - Better handling of lines from external multiplier file
      * Allow comment lines (starting with '#')
      * strip leading and trailing whitespace
      * drop empty lines
         
    - New actual cty.dat file (December 2011). Thanks Martin OK1RR.

Fixed bugs:
    - segfaults due to a racing condition if heavy load on cluster
    - '+' and 'INSERT' keys in call and exchange input field respects
      CTCOMPATIBLE mode now
    - Allow edit of old QSO's only if call field is empty
    - Fix display of section in ARRL_SS and recognition of 'U' precedent
    - Fix upper boundaries for 160 and 40 meters.
    - Correct rescoring for WYSIWYG_* methods
    - keywords in logcfg.dat needs to start at column 0
    - correction of spelling errors and drop of old infos from man page
    - a lot of fixes of old problems:
      * proper locking to prevent racing conditions 
      * fix bad scoring of multis
      * correct position of pfx display in bottom line of check window
      * correct display of 1A stations in info line
      * wrong return value from searchcallarray
      * wrong handling of corner cases for some internal array scans

Reworked internal structure:
    - did some modernisation of configure.ac
    - start to use ncurses panel functions for overlapping windows and
      glib-2 for effective handling of large data collections
    - switch cty data handling and mults_possible to growing arrays and
      therefore allowing unlimited number of entries
    - simplify and drop unneeded code

tlf-1.0.5
=========
maintenance release
    * fixes some nasty racing condition between bandmap code and 
      checkwindow. In result prefix in lower line of checkwindow
      got displayed wrong, but country was right.
      Thanks Martin OK1RR for reporting.

tlf-1.0.4
=========
maintenance release
 * fix for wrong handling of recalled exchange (tnx OK1RR).
   New policy is a s follows
      - All calls from initial exchange file will be recognised even
	if part of a complex call, e.g. DL1CCL in LA/DL1CCL/p 
      - All calls from former QSO's have to be exact including any
	pre- or postcombination
      - Now complete exchange will be recalled (not only first word)

tlf-1.0.3
=========
maintenance release
 * fix buffer overflow in 'send_lan_message'
 * fix wrong count of points and qso's for last band entry (tnx OK1RR)

tlf-1.0.2
=========
maintenance release
 * fix bug in sendto call in TLF-1.0.0 and 1.0.1. 
   cwdaemon needs a zero terminated string. 

tlf-1.0.1
=========
maintenance release
 * fix logfile read error. Last QSO got read twice.
 * fix bug in cty.dat and in the routine which reads in the file
   Some prefixes from BY were not recognised.
 * fix calculation of sun up and down time in MUF prediction window.
   It is now based on longitude from country description in cty.dat 
   instead of the former timezone difference. That should be more
   accurate now.

tlf-1.0.0
=========

Major cleanup release. Fixes lot of buffer overruns in string handling, which 
stopped old version from working with new GCC and GLIBC.
 * Better recognition of hamlib install (tnx F8FCE) 
 * Rewrote handling of initial exchange file. It now allows empty 
   and comment lines (#) and spaces around the callsign. Leading 
   space before comment gets ignored.
 * Changed ESC handling in comment and call input field:
   Does no longer wipe out call and exchange field if you started sending.
 * New callmaster and cty.dat file (tnx OK1RR).

Bugfixes:
 * Fix input handling of notes.
 * Fix autocq handling. 
   - First characters gets no longer swallowed.
   - CQDELAY from logcfg.dat is now handled correct.
 * fix calculation of sunrise and sunset times 
 * fix calculation of QSO Rate
 * fix parsing for MARKERDOTS and MARKERCALL keywords in logcfg.dat
 * make Backspace and Delete-Keys the same to allow some more terminal 
   input encodings

tlf-0.9.31-2
============

'Possible calls' are now in top left corner, and share the space with 
the keyer. The 'possible calls' routine first checks the own log 
and then the callmaster database.
Calls can now be up to 12 characters

tlf-0.9.31
==========

Fix for buffer overflow. 'Worked' window now searches from start of callsign.

tlf-0.9.30
==========
Bug fixes:
- exchange needed at least 1 character in dxped mode

RTTY miniterm changed to display line feeds (reading formatted texst is easier)
RTTY now sends linefeeds before and after the macro.

tlf-0.9.29
==========
Bug fixes:
- Date display error
- Spurious character error
- Malloc free error in socket.c
I also included Fabian's patch to searchlog.c for testing...I like it.

tlf-0.9.28
==========
Bug fixes (country indication did not work, wrong mults file for arrldx_dx).
Added interface to gMFSK to enable RTTY contesting.
Added new parameters for the logcfg.dat file:
	GMFSK (use gMFSK as an output device)
	RTTYMODE (start tlf in RTTY mode)
	DIGIMODEM=/home/youruser/gmfsk_autofile

You need the special version of gMFSK which is used for pskmail (http://pskmail.wikispaces.com).
Information on how to install this hacked version of gMFSK-0.6 is on the pskmail wiki.
Tlf takes care of all contest related stuff, exactly as you are used to in CW mode... 
Yyou can use keyboard mode (Alt-K in CW mode) by switching to the gMFSK send field 
with "Alt-TAB". This toggles between tlf and gMFSK.
This will be necessary until I have time to redo the gMFSK interface (a socket interface is 
on the todo list).

tlf-0.9.27
==========
Bug fixes (segfault at startup at some systems)

tlf-0.9.26
==========
Bug fix (segfault using the voice keyer).

tlf-0.9.25
==========

Bug fix for non-hamlib compilation

tlf-0.9.24
==========

- Code adaptation to compile with gcc-4.0 without warnings and segfaults (will compile on UBUNTU-5.10, FC4 etc..).

tlf-0.9.23
==========

- New function: start cw before call is complete. In contest mode, you can 
  start sending the call from the call window with 'space' or with 'down-arrow'.
- New command: :CHAR asks for number of characters the call must have 
  before sending starts. Default: 0 = OFF. If CHARS is 3, tlf starts sending 
  as soon as you have input the first 3 letters of the call. If you are on 
  slow speed you then have time to complete the call (including backspacing) 
  before sending the first 3 letters is finished. This is of limited use when 
  running above 40 wpm :)
- incorporated patch from W9WI fixing a bug in the voice keyer.
- changed cw speed control: now default active in call and exchange fields, 
  even if field is not empty
- changed qso save logic: RETURN now always logs the qso in SSB and in general 
  qso mode.
- New parameter: CHANGE_RST. If set in logcfg.dat, Pg-up and Pg-down will 
  change RST instead of CW speed if field is not empty. Default: off.
- fixed nasty bug which caused CQDELAY to start at 0 instead of the default 
  in logcfg.dat
- manpage updated for version 0.9.23

tlf-0.9.22
==========

This release fixes a bug to make it compatible with gcc-4.0 / AMD64

- The (local swedish) ssa_mt contest has changed its exchange format into 
  serial number + 4-character grid field. This made it necessary to make 
  a new parameter called SERIAL+GRID4. Tlf extracts the first 4 characters 
  for the multiplier. Input format:
  e.g. 001 JO21QI, the mult will be JO21. The rules file has also been updated.
- Man page updated for version 0.9.22.

tlf-0.9.21
==========

This release includes all the patches I received over the last 6 month. 
Besides making the code more stable, it will enable compilation with gcc 3.4. 
Further it should be compatible with cwdaemon-0.9 (weighting -50...50). 
I also got a patch to cure a problem with the qso logic, 2x escape will 
now reset the qso logic as soon as the call field is empty again.
TNX PG4I, VA3DB, OM4AA. 
Also the anonymous contributions I got through the bugtracker are very welcome!!

- Changes: 
- the cw sidetone setting (TONE) in logcfg.dat has become CWTONE=...
- a new parameter LOWBANDS_DOUBLE has been introduced (points x 2 for 40-80-160)
- a new parameter CLUSTER_LOG has been introduced. When set the cluster 
  messages are writteni to a 'clusterlog' file... this can be tailed to a 
  terminal window (tail -f clusterlog)
- the initial exchange function now also recognises embedded calls (PA/OK1RR/P)
- The logcfg.dat template has been updated to version 0.9.21.
- The manpage has been updated to version 0.9.21.

tlf-0.9.20
==========

- Bug fixed: In cw keyboard, ENTER produced a newline
- Bug fixed: In cw keyboard PgUp and PgDwn did not change the cw speed
- Bug fixed: The ';' was missing in "note-in-log" if the LAN was not active
- Bug fixed: Added <unistd.h>  to startmsg.c
- Bugs fixed: Buffer size handling in various places (tnx for the patch !!)
- Added OPEN BSD support to audio.c/h (tnx for the patch!)

- Added test version of CWBANDWIDTH=xxx to set bandwidth from Hamlib when 
  mode is switched:
	A value of 0 to switch off automatic mode switching
	A value of x for setting the bandwidth
	If the parameter is not there, PASSBAND_NORMAL is used (default)
This test version works for cw only.


tlf-0.9.19
==========

- Added INITIAL_EXCHANGE facility.
  Format: INITIAL_EXCHANGE=names.txt
  The file must contain a comma-separated list of exchanges, if e.g. the 
  exchange is the name of the operator:
  PA0R,rein
  PG4I,joop
  OK1RR,martin
  The file can be any length.
  If RECALL_MULTS is set, tlf will look in this list for the exchange and 
  fill it in for you.  There are various contests which have a standard 
  exchange, like e.g. the FOC Marathon.
- Doubled the arrays for the cty.dat list, to enable larger-than-standard 
  custom lists. Also set the max. number of mults to 500 per band (these 
  values can be set in tlf.h at compile time).
- The "note in log" (';') function will not indicate "Node 'X' , qsonumber" 
  if the LAN is not active. 

tlf-0.9.18
==========

Version 0.9.18 only adds native support for the ten tec ORION, to bridge 
the time until Hamlib has an appropriate driver.
Use RIGMODEL=ORION if you have one. This works with or without Hamlib installed.
Set RIGSPEED=57600.
The driver uses the internal keyer of the ORION, so you don't need cwdaemon i
either (unless you use the tlf voice keyer which uses cwdaemon's PTT output, 
or an automatic antenna switch controlled by tlf).
- I also added a :debug_tty command to test rig links.

tlf-0.9.17
==========

- New sound record feature"
	New command :SOUnd
	F1 ... F12, s, c will record the voice keyer message for that key
	1:	Start contest recording to ddhhmm.au
	2:	Stop contest recording
	3:	Play back contest recording ddhh[mm][xx]
		xx is the offset from the start of the file e.g.:
		2110 will start from beginning of the day 21 hr 10:00 file.
		21100013:00 will start from day 21, hh 10, mm 00, + 13 minutes: 0 seconds
	To make sure you get a new file every hour make a cron job to run i
	every hour with:
		/usr/bin/pkill -f sox > /dev/null 2> /dev/null
	Once started the recorder will run until the lock file ~/.VRlock is 
	removed.

- Bug fixes from the EA RTTY test:
	Rtty miniterminal improved... wrote to :info, :packet and :help screens
	S&P mode sent no call with F1
- Added new command :RTTY. This one will switch the MFJ1278B controller 
  into RTTY mode.
-- Fixes from the WPX-SSB contest (PI4TUE):
	Operator got into log view (LESS) and could not get out:
		tlf will not go from edit into log view anymore (use :VIEW)
	Operator gives out wrong serial number after the run stn updates the i
	number:
		the serial number to be given is now printed prominently 
		below the call field.
- Added new parameter: CLUSTERLOGIN=pi4tue-1
	if this parameter is present tlf will automatically login a 
	telnet cluster using the call mentioned. This makes it easier for 
	non-linux users to start the program.

- :HELP will show a file 'help.txt' instead of the man page. This file can 
  be contest/operator specific. Make your own....
- Autocq: Tlf will stop sending as soon as a call is written into the call field
- Tlf will now send LSB or USB to the rig, depending on band. In RTTY mode 
  the rig stays in LSB, no matter which band.


tlf-0.9.15
==========

- Added support for MFJ1278B multi-mode controller.
	You can now use your MFJ1278B as a CW  output
	device with the same controls as for the software keyers
	(ctrl-k for keyboard mode, escape to leave keyboard mode, pgup
	for speed-up and pg-down for speed-down).

	The RTTY mode enables the RTTY contests with the same user
	interface as with the CW contests, also AMTOR is supported.

	New parameter for logcfg.dat: MFJ1278_KEYER=,
	e.g. MFJ1278_KEYER=/dev/ttyS0
	New characters for RTTY keyboard mode:
	'{' TX
	'}' RX
	'\' Enter Command Mode
	'K' <ENTER> Leave command mode.
	',' (comma) or Ctrl-k to go into keyboard mode
	ESCAPE to leave keyboard mode.
	The '{' and '}' characters can also be embedded in the Contest messages
	e.g. F1={RYRY TEST DE % % PSE K} will transmit the message and switch back to RX.

	New command ':MINiterm' to toggle a 5 x 40 char terminal window on/off.
	This will only work in DIG mode.

- Added experimental :SCAnner function (an idea of OK1RR)
	The SCAnner function combines the Frequency Control function of Hamlib
	with a rudimentary Audio S-Meter/plotter via the sound card. Just 
	connect the rx output to the soundcard input and you are o.k.
	Two functions are supported by version 0.9.15:

	Band Scan Function - can be used as a 'second hand' to scan a band 
	for activity with a separate receiver + computer.
	You give a Start frequency and a step frequency, and the "S-Meter" 
	values are plotted.

	SWR scan function - with a simple noise bridge and a computer 
	controlled rx as a frequency-stepped detector you can plot antenna
	swr or filter transfer characteristic.

	New parameters for logcfg.dat:
	SC_DEVICE= Sound card device, e.g. SC_DEVICE=/dev/dsp0
	S_METER=  Calibration curve for the Audio S-Meter. As the audio 
	  volume depends on the transfer characteristic of your rx (incl. AGC) 
	  you have to calibrate the S-Meter. With this parameter you can 
	  create a curve with 20 points e.g.:
		S_METER=20,19,18,17,16,15,14,13,12,11,10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1
	  would create a linear curve with a max. value of 20. (Of course 
	  you will need	something logarithmic).
		Maximum value = 255 (8 bits).
	ESCAPE to go back to the previous level.

- Bug fixes by PA3FWM



tlf-0.9.11
==========

- Added support for Cwdaemon-0.8
	New parameters for logcfg.dat:
	- SOUNDCARD set sidetone output device to soundcard.
	- SIDETONE_VOLUME=<0 ... 99>  set sidetone volume on soundcard
- Changed auto-cq delay to 1/2 second increments.
- updated cty.dat file (11/15 version)
- added usa_canada_states file

tlf-0.9.10
==========

- Added SSBPOINTS= to set points per SSB qso

- Added CWPOINTS= to set points per CW qso

- Extended pr_hostaddress string to hold 47 characters (for long host names)
	(try TELNETHOST=claudia.esrac.ele.tue.nl
	TELNETPORT=8000)


tlf-0.9.9
=========

- Tlf now uses the original cty.dat file, not necessary to convert to ctydb.dat.

- Bug fix: KH2/KK2H and KK2H/KH2 now both in GUAM.

- Included the changes Bob N7XY made to cty.dat. Also added TO0O (in Martinique)

tlf-0.9.8
=========

- Changed time-to-live default for DX spots to 30 minutes. This can be changed 
  at compile time with the MAXMINUTES constant in cluster_bg.h

- Added station ID to log line when logging from different nodes in the
  network.
  This enables post-contest analysis and log massage after the contest.
  CQWW_M2 must be set in logcfg.dat for this.

- Added qso number and NODE ID to note in log for post contest analysis.

- Added code to prevent double node id's in the network. If tlf hears it's 
  own node id on the network, it will ask for another one.

- Added :SYNc command, which will resync the logfile and recalculate the score
  without restarting the program. The automatic resync at program restart has
  been disabled, as it was generating too many problems. So the only way to
  resync the log is using the :SYNC command.

- Added :REScore command, which will recalculate the score without having to
  restart the program.

- Bug fix: /MM and /AM stations now have no country (no country multiplier
  value for cqww, only the zone), but do count for points. Tlf tries to
  calculate the continent from the zone. This is necessary to calculate the
  points.

tlf-0.9.7
=========

- Added new parameter for logcfg.dat:
	SYNCFILE=user:password@host/dir/syncfile (wget syntax).

  When you start tlf with this parameter in logcfg.dat tlf will wget the
  logfile from the relevant node, make a dated backup of your local logfile,
  and merge the 2 files. WARNING: this contains the password of the remote
  machine so I also:

- Added a new startup option for tlf: -s<remote file name> : 
    tlf -suser:password@host/dir/syncfile 
  will sync the local logfile at startup.

- Added parameter to change colors (defaults remain as usual):
	TLFCOLOR1=23		(Header and footer)
	TLFCOLOR2=67		(Pop up windows)
	TLFCOLOR3=70		(Log window)
	TLFCOLOR4=57		(Markers/dupe colour)
	TLFCOLOR5=43		(Input fields)
	TLFCOLOR6=70		(Window frames)
	The numbers in octal, fg/bg or bg/fg (you have to try it).
  You should only specify these if you don't agree with the standard colours 
  of tlf.

- Call edit mode is now default INSERT mode (log edit remains OVERWRITE mode).

- Bug fix: CE0Y/SP9DTP was wrongly located in Poland (also works for VP2E now :-)

tlf-0.9.6
=========

- 2 x escape in the exchange field will return to call field and clear it.

- Patch for configure.in to enable build under BSD (warning: tlf segfaults
  under BSD, the cause is being investigated). Tnx Joop PG4I

- Changed cabrillo for serial + section multiplier (e.g. ssa mt contest)

- Patch from LU4HKN to change version automatically in cabrillo file

- Patch from Stephane F8CFE to add new parameter for rig control:
	RIGCONF=civaddr=0x40,retry=3,rig_pathname=/dev/ttyS0
	which will send rig configuration info to Hamlib.

- Added new parameter for logcfg.dat:
	SYNCFILE=user:password@host/dir/syncfile (wget syntax).

  When you start tlf with this parameter in logcfg.dat tlf will wget the
  logfile from the relevant node, make a dated backup of your local logfile,
  and merge the 2 files. WARNING: this contains the password of the remote
  machine so I also:

- Added a new startup option for tlf: -s<remote file name> :
	tlf -suser:password@host/dir/syncfile will sync the local logfile at startup.

- Added parameter to change colors (defaults remain as usual):
	TLFCOLOR1=23		(Header and footer)
	TLFCOLOR2=67		(Pop up windows)
	TLFCOLOR3=70		(Log window)
	TLFCOLOR4=57		(Markers/dupe colour)
	TLFCOLOR5=43		(Input fields)
	TLFCOLOR6=63		(Window frames)
	The numbers in octal, fg/bg or bg/fg (you have to try it).
	You should only specify these if you don't agree with the standard colours of tlf.

- Call edit mode is now default INSERT mode (log edit remains OVERWRITE mode).

- Bug fix: CE0Y/SP9DTP was wrongly located in Poland (also works for VP2E now :-)



tlf-0.9.5
=========

- added SSA_MT contest (beta...)

- added capital 'Y' to exit check.

- added new parameter: NO_BANDSWITCH_ARROWKEYS
	this will prevent unwanted band switching when you are not using
	rig control. Band up=alt-b, band down = alt-v (Trlog compatible).
	
- bug fix: qso number was increased on "notes" line

- bug fix: zone number was overwritten by the network

- bug fix: table overrun in packet modules when too many spots/h came in
	caused segfault.

tlf-0.9.4
=========

- added band output routine for cwdaemon-0.7.
	New parameter: BANDOUTPUT to switch it on.
	Cwdaemon-0.7 will output band info on pins 2, 7,8 and 9 of the
	parallel port. 160m = 1, 80m = 2 .... 10m = 9. This is compatible with 
	commercial band decoders. 	
	You can also use different coding:
	BANDOUTPUT=12484848 will put pin 9 high to switch your 3-bander etc... 
	no need for a decoder, a few relays will do... unless you also want 
	to switch your bandfilters.
	
- known bugs: 
	tlf seg faults when switching from the NEEDED band map to the 
	spot list with very large band maps (the 10m bandmap had 150 entries 
	during cqwwssb sunday afternoon)
	ce0y/sp9spt shows up as Poland instead of Easter Island...

tlf-0.9.3
=========

- Bug fix: Speed setting from logcfg.dat erratic. Changed parameter to
	CWSPEED=xx (was SPEED=xx).
	
- Bug fix: The auto cq function could not be stopped with ESCAPE

- Changed parameter input for TNCPORT and RIGPORT. The parameters now
  accept direct path entry: e.g. RIGPORT=/dev/ttyS0 or TNCPORT=/dev/ttyUSB1.
  Tnx ZL2BSJ for the help. This adds USB capability to tlf...

- Added parameter NOAUTOCQ which switches off the auto_cq function

- Added parameter SSBMODE to start tlf in ssb mode (does not switch the rig).

- Added possibility to have several logcfg.dat files:
  Start tlf with tlf -f<filename>. You can now have different configurations
  per operator. e.g. tlf -fPA0RCT, tlf -fHB9FBL etc...
  Tlf first looks at the -f parameter, and expects the file in the
  working directory (e.g. /home/yourcall/contest/2003/cqwwcw/logcfg.dat).
  The default filename is logcfg.dat. If there is no config file in the
  working directory tlf opens PACKAGE_DATA_DIR/logcfg.dat, READ ONLY (often
  needs root privileges).
  You will need to change the call and other parameters on that one.
	
- :HELp now displays the manpage.

- :INFo now also displays the relevant filenames, addresses, and ports.


tlf-0.9.2
=========

- Added Adif export capability. The command :ADIf will write the logfile i
  properly (I hope) formatted to a file with a .adif suffix.

- Fixed bug in cqww contest: when a new spot arrived the cq zone would be
  changed.

- Added new method to handle contest rules (by LZ3NY): 

  You can put general parameters, which are the same for all contests (call,
  keyer speed, window handling etc.) into logcfg.dat.  Put
  CONTEST=<contest_name> into logcfdg.dat.

  Tlf now first looks if there is a directory "rules/" in the working
  directory, e.g. /home/yourcall/tlf/2003/cqwwcw. It then loads the file
  <contest_name> 	which contains the 	rules for that contest. If the
  directory "rules/" is not available there, tlf will look into
  /usr/local/share/tlf/rules, and try to load the file <contest_name> from
  there. If not available tlf will set the contest to "qso".

  This will make it easier to publish the rules files for various contests.  If
  you programmed and tested a new contest, please send the rules file to
  PA0R@EUDXF.ORG so I can add it to the distribution.

- Added support for MC editor (by LZ3NY)

- Added QUIT command (by LZ3NY)

- Added WAZMULT (by LZ3NY). Uses Cqzone as multiplier.

- Added ITUMULT (by LZ5NY). Uses ITUzone as multiplier

- Added CQDELAY parameter for setting cqdelay in logcfg.dat (by LZ3NY)

- Added PFX_MULT (works like in wpx)

- Added Dynamic check for users terminal type (defaults to rxvt) (by LZ3NY).

- Added experimental support for xterm. Sometimes xterm starts with the wrong
  keyboard map. This is the case when the arrow keys don't work. Remedy
  (workaround) is to first switch into the shell (with "!") and back to tlf
  (with "exit"). The arrow keys as well as the function keys will now work in
  most cases. Please report irregularities to PA0R@EUDXF.ORG, I don't expect it
  to work everywhere. Also the color scheme is the best I could do with the
  standard colours of xterm. I prefer rxvt!

- Changed cw keyer speed control back to pg-up/pg-down. Alt-v will only work in
  CT compatibility mode.

- Changed cqdelay control to ctrl-pgup/ctrl-pgdown. Ctrl-pgup is not possible
  with TERM=linux, so I had to add a command :CQDelay which will do the same.

- Added band switch control with Alt-v and Alt-b (to be compatible with TRLog),
  right/left arrow will work also

- Added Alt-e control to enter edit qso's mode (to be compatible with TRLog),
  up-arrow will work also.

tlf-0.9.1
=========

- Added PFX_MULT, wpx-style multiplier.

- Added RXVT parameter (logcfg.dat) which sets the colours for using tlf in an
  rxvt terminal.

tlf-0.9.0
==========

- Added experimental voice keyer support for soundcards, based on the sox
  package.  The voice keyer works as soon as the mode is SSB and you have
  nominated at least 1 sound file.

- added parameters to logcfg.dat for the voice keyer. They are e.g.:

#################################
#                               #
#  Voice Keyer Files            #

VKSPR=/home/rein/tlf/spreturn.wav (S&P return message)
VKCWR=/home/rein/tlf/qsl.wav	(CQ mode return message)
#

- You have to make your files off line. As tlf uses sox, most audio files can
  be played.

- You can test the voice keyer capability with "play audiofile.xx".  If that
  works you are o.k. I have used sox-12.17 for testing.

- The voice keyer uses the same qso logic as TRlog in cw, you only have to say
  the call and press ENTER twice... (if the exchange is standard, like in the
  cqww)

- If you want to use the PTT line, the cwdaemon must run as well.

- You have to invent your own hardware interface to the trx (there are numerous
  examples floating around the net...)

** comments please **

tlf-0.8.23
==========
- bug fix: zone could not be changed from default in cqww


tlf-0.8.22
==========

- Added -x option to use rxvt colours and keys.

- Changed sections exchange check routine to accept 1 character mults.

- Updated manpage

tlf-0.8.21
==========

- Added TXDELAY (Turn On Delay) control for cwdaemon.
	The value of TOD from logcfg.dat is sent to the keyer at startup.
	Value range is 0 ... 50 ms (0 switches PTT off completely)
	
- Added Alt-t command for TUNE  (stops with any key)

- Added Alt-p command for PTT on|off

- Added Ctrl-r command to switch lp0-pin 14 on|off (SSB mic|SSS Soundcard)

- Some cosmetic changes to the Alt-w (weight) dialogue


tlf-0.8.20
==========

- Made tlf compatible with hamlib-1.1.4 (new rig.h).

- Added fast startup (now default).

- Verbose startup with -v option

- Version output with -V option

- Debug mode with -d option (to check rigctl)

- Added dialogue window for CW speed and weight setting (Alt-v and Alt-w).

	(incl. cabrillo output).
	
- Added manpage (tlf.1)

tlf-0.8.19
==========

- Added flexible point parameters for logcfg.dat (tnx for contribution Mitko,
  LZ3NY):

	COUNTRYLIST=SP	List of countries that have exceptional points.
			Format e.g. OH,OH0,OJ0M,SM,OZ,OY,OX etc...
  You can also give a file name, and put the country information into a file 
  (prefixed with contest name, e.g. NRAUTEST:OH,OH0,...).
		
	COUNTRY_LIST_POINTS=5	All countries in the list get 5 points
		
	USE_COUNTRYLIST_ONLY	Only countries in the list get (5) points,
				all others 0.
		
	MY_COUNTRY_POINTS=1		My own country gets 1 point
	MY_CONTINENT_POINTS=2		Other countries in my continent get 
					2 points
	DX_POINTS=10			DX countries get 10 points
		
  The above only takes care of the points, not the multipliers!!
  You can combine this system with e.g. a WYSIWYG_MULTIBAND  or a COUNTRY_MULT,
  a MULT_LIST or SECTIONS.
		
  Please try this well before the contest, so there is still time to
  make changes if needed!!

- Added possibility to give > 9 points (e.g. CQWW-160m)

- Added weight control (Alt-w) for netkeyer (-5 ... 5)

- Tlf now sends weight from logcfg.dat to netkeyer at startup

  don't want it set NOB4 in logcfg.dat. The b4 message must be in F7.

- fixed bug in searchlog which made P3A a dupe when you worked YP3A.

- changed all pictures in the manual to png format.

tlf-0.8.15
========

- fixed bug leading to SEGFAULT when using shift_F1...F8

- quick fix for bug leading to segfault when tlf is started on a terminal with
  COLUMNS > 80

- shift_F1...F8 now starts change message for F1...F8 (shift_function key may
  not work at some terminals!!)

- MARKERS=<path_to_markerfile> writes a marker file for Xplanet, containing the
  last 8 entries to the spot list or the bandmap (whichever is active).



tlf-0.8.14
========

- added section mult capability (exchange = mult = section from file)

tlf-0.8.13
========

- reworked bandmap.  Goto bandmap with "." or "Alt_," switch between "all"  and
  "needed" with "." scroll with up/down and pg-up/pgdown, leave with ESC.

- colour coding for bandmap (only works for contest bands).

- grab spot (ctrl-g) with empty call field takes last one in spot list

tlf-0.8.10a
=========

- fixed bug "tlf does not start without a logfile" 


tlf-0.8.10
========

Bug/unwanted feature fixes:

- when adding a note ';', it kills the data in the current QSO field

- when deleting last QSO '-', and the last QSO was a Note,
  QSO's in SCORE window is wrong (QSO's count decremented while it
  shouldn't)

- when call field is empty, is TAB supposed to give a zone?

- when editing last QSO '@', if I go right (with -> key) till end of line,
  I'm stuck on next line. Actually, If you enter "ggggggggggggggggggggggggg"
  past the end of line, it will overflow to the next line. And there's no
  solution to go back (ESC and :edit to fix it though) But the screen looks
  ugly in the mean time.

- tlf does not handle very well bogus .log text files.
  mostly FIXED, needs more work

- entering edit last '@', and add an extra 9 to 59 report (I know this is
  silly in SSB mode), you can replace the char but you cannot suppr the
  extra 9 (either with del or backspace).

- when editing call field with left key, it gets green on orange.
  but when I do a replace (overwrite a char), the field looses color
  back to yellow on blue, but I'm still in edit mode!

- disable "ZONEDISPLAY is 1" message on ":zone" cmd

- allow ENTER key in exchange field

- backspace in edit field mode

tlf-0.8.9   Beta for CT adepts.....
=======

- after making some 3000 qso's with CT at CT9L in the cqww I added the most
important CT commands to tlf. See the new Alt-H command for details...

- The up-arrow will now lead into the qso  editor as requested by CT freaks...

- The CW keyer speed can be adjusted with Alt-V or from within the keyboard routine
(Alt-K, ctrl-K or ,), with up/down arrow.

- For CT compatibility mode (use Insert and + for running) uncomment the
CTCOMPATIBLE command in logcfg.dat.  There is NO S&P mode, and Enter will log the qso.
(But you asked for it...)


tlf-0.8.7
=======

- added time sync protocol for networked nodes.

- add TIME_MASTER to logcfg.dat for the master station.

- the "@" command now allows to edit the qso's visible (5 qso's).  During edit
mode LAN receive is stopped. Leave edit mode with enter, tab or esc.

- changed insert mode for call edit. 

tlf-0.8.6
=======

-   Bug fixes for CQWW-CW:
	-    	W/VE zones default according to all area

	-       Zone correction in exchange field (04 3 )
	- 	Call correction in exchange field (04 W7KJ ) when CALLUPDATE is set in logcfg.dat
	-	D4B, VP2E, VP2M, VP2V, PY0FF, NP2, WP2 now correctly scored
	-	R1ANZ is now CE9 in zone 29
	-	TA1 is correctly placed in zone 20 (EU)
	-	W2XXX/TI8 now handled correctly
	-	Fixed segmentation fault when too many input chars in input field
	-       Right tlf version in cabrillo file
	-	Edit last qso can now be closed also with enter and tab.

tlf-0.8.5
=======

- added parameter TIME_OFFSET= to logcfg.dat. It enables you to use the computer
at local time, while tlf logs in utc. Use any value between -23 ... 23. In PA0 the value is -1 for
winter time.

- in cqww in-country qso's count 0 points also in NA.


tlf-0.8.4 beta for arrl sweepstakes
=======

- use CONTEST=arrl_ss in logcfg.dat

============================================

- all rig control related functions were changed to work with hamlib-1.1.3

- just compile hamlib-1.1.3 (./configure, make, make install, that's all!!)

- this tlf version needs hamlib-1.1.3 library. You may have to do /sbin/ldconfig ,
    so tlf can find the lib at startup !!

- tested o.k. for the omni 6 plus. For the rit of the omni and icom rigs you need a patch.

- grab spot (ctrl-G) only works in band map

- add spot (ctrl-A) adds call in call field to bandmap

- frequency control (ctrl-F): up/down arrow for 100 Hz, left/right arrow 20 Hz steps.
	escape goes back to normal mode

 - mode switch :SSB now gives right side band (USB, LSB)

 - I need reports on tlf/rig compatibility (see Hamlib on source forge for lists)      !!


tlf-0.6.1  beta test version of telnet / tnc support
====================================================

- fixed bug gobbling up display when long buffers came in

- added FIFO clfile

- preliminary fix for band map display

Use of FIFO input:

- comment out the telnet and tnc interfaces in logcfg.dat

- uncomment FIFO_INTERFACE

- start e.g. call -r <packetinterface> | tee <tlfworkingdirectory>/clfile


tlf-0.6.0  beta test version of telnet / tnc support
====================================================

bugs: band map not ready (work in progress)
